<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>For a night and a day Tristan le Sauvage had
watched his arms before the high altar of the chapel
of Purple Isle. For a night and a day he had seen
the long tapers glimmering towards their silver
sockets, under the painted roof. Dawn light and
evening glow had shone through the latticed casements
east and west, dusting the stones with colour,
carving deep shadows from sculptured pillar and
from moulded arch. Not a sound had broken the
silence of the tombs. Alone before the Great
Cross, Tristan had kept vigil, chastening his manhood
for quest beyond the sea. Two months had
passed since a great ship with gleaming sails had
swooped like a falcon upon Purple Isle, and carried
thence that white dove, Columbe the Fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had descended in a whorl of crimson
flame when Tristan rose up from before the altar,
and passed out to his kinsfolk who had gathered
at sunset in the chapel court. The moon had
climbed the starry port of heaven. In the court
lamps flickered, and white faces peered at him
like pale flowers out of the gloom. The delicate
finials of many cypresses were smitten with the
moonlight; a thin perfume of spring quivered in
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the chapel gate stood Father Madan of
the Isle, clad in his Mass robes, his white beard
silvered by the light of the moon. Four acolytes
stood round him with bell and aspergil, ewer and
book. Maidens in white bore garlands of primrose
and of violet on crosses of white wood. There was
a deep silence through all the court, as Tristan
came out from the inmost shadow, his head bowed
over his broad chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan le Sauvage was no lover of priests.
Frocks and stoles were women’s gear. It was
with no great grace that he went on his knees on
the bare stones at Madan’s, feet, while the old
man stretched out his thin white hands over him
like a snowy Druid uttering incantations under
the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son Tristan,” quoth the priest, with that
innocent unction beloved of women, “hath the
good God chastened thee for this thy quest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan hated parade with the great sinews of
his heart. He was a surly soul, a bad courtier
at the crook of the knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son Tristan,” said the priest again, “the
buckler of Faith awaits your arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sharpened my sword, O Father,” said
the man on the stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madan knew well this unpolished rock, the
granite that loved the billow’s blow better than
the honeyed voice of a lute. He forgave the untamed
temper of youth, and blessed him as he
knelt at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His kinsfolk gathered under the long shadows
of the cypresses. Dame Joan, his mother, drew
near, and kissed his lips. Her hands lay heavy
upon his shoulders; her face shone white under
her pure grey hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” said she, “the good saints strengthen
you. Thrice blessed am I in the manhood of my
son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother,” he answered her simply enough,
overshadowing her with his great strength, “God
by your love has given me a good schooling.
Therefore be comforted. Columbe, my sister, shall
return to you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had hung upon his bosom, Dame
Joan kissed him, as did his sire and Lavaine, his
brother. They were brave folk, simple of heart,
open-souled towards Heaven. Love with them was
as an eternal prayer winging at dawn and eve to
the throne of God. Girded from the great world
by the waste of waters, they lived their lives in
the strong purity of virgin faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The full moon gazed on them as they passed
down from the chapel towards the sea. A thousand
pines thrust up their midnight spears towards
the stars. Deep to the confines of the dusky sky
the far sea glimmered, washing the island with
a sheet of foam. Madan the monk led on the
company, acolytes, maidens, and young men
chanting together under the moon. Tristan
walked at his mother’s side. With solemn
song and the faint pulsing of the chapel
bell, they brought him slowly towards the
strand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a black inlet, bulwarked from the broad
vigour of the sea, a galley lay moored beside
a rude stone quay. The water was scolloped
all with silver round the sable rocks. A great
glistening highway stretched over the ocean
towards the east.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the galley’s bulwarks Tristan took leave
of his mother and his sire. He sprang down
behind the thwarts and took the tiller in his hand.
The black sail climbed the mast; the long sweeps
smote silver from the swirling pool. Madan stood
forward and blessed him as the prow rose to the
waves. Thus Tristan le Sauvage put out from
Purple Isle, and followed the moon’s highway
over the sea.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The tall hills of a strange land rose athwart the
deepening azure of the second dawn. Spears of
light fell streaming towards the sea, glittering
upon the ever-tumbling waves that hurried onwards
towards the west. The stars sped back
behind the veil. The faint moon grew frail as a
great silver net burdened with transient dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan le Sauvage, steering the boat, sat with
his eyes fixed upon the misty heights touched with
the golden glories of the dawn. Before him the
multitudinous waves leapt and tumbled, washing
the bulwarks, plashing against the prow with a
moist unrest. A light breeze bellied the black
sail, set the cordage creaking and humming about
the mast. The world seemed full of the awakening
day and the sinuous and solemn splendour of
the sea. The waves were troughed with opalescent
light as they swept and heaved about the boat.
There was a salt zest in the ocean’s breathing, a
deep intake of strength into its panting heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men at the benches watched Tristan le
Sauvage as they dipped their sweeps. The dawn
light shone upon his rugged face and the links
of his hauberk. There was no uglier man in
Purple Isle than Tristan le Sauvage. Nature had
juggled with him from his earliest years. Of no
great stature, he was like a tough oak, cumbrous,
huge of trunk, and gnarled of limb. The long
arms showed their great muscles even under the
sleeves of his hauberk. His chest was as the
front of some great rock; his heavy head seemed
sunk betwixt his shoulders; his legs bowed as by
the massive strength above. A pair of dusky eyes
peered out with honest faith from a craggy, hairless
countenance. The broad mouth was pursed
up half morosely over the strong white teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the pilgrim who plied the tiller,
helming the boat towards the broadening day.
Tristan spoke seldom, crying now and again to
Rolf the pilot, as the boat heaved and rolled over
the waves. His eyes were fixed on the hills that
rose above the waste of waters. Black cliffs,
craggy and solemn, began to frown upon the sea.
The far heights bristled with woodland, shimmering
with magic mystery under the rising sun.
The moist surge of the sea cheered on the galley
towards the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood to the tiller, and scanned the
strange coast under his hand. The wind freshened,
the sail bellied from the mast, the toilers drew in
their oars, and watched the coast-line rising from
the foam. Like battlements of black marble, the
cliffs towered above the blue shallows, with rocky
pinnacle and forest spire smitten from the east
with a glamour of gold. Precipice and wooded
height were solitary as the sea itself. No tower
crowned the headlands, no town lurked in the
green shadows of the placid bays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rolf, old senator of the seas, stood forward in
the prow, gazing at the line of heights. Straight
to the east a narrow valley thrust upwards from
the sea, walled on either hand with cliff and forest
slope. Rolf hailed Tristan to the prow, and
pointed with knotted finger to the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Land of the Seven Streams, sir,” he
said to him. “I know these cliffs of old. See
yonder valley; the Silver Snake runs therein, a
great river and a strong. The stars have steered
us well. Hold for the opening in the cliffs; we
can ride in over the bar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running fast on the backs of the billows, they
came to where a counter current beat upon the
prow, fretting the sea into contending streams. It
was where the river charged the tide. The galley
swerved and faltered; the sail flapped against the
mast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out sweeps,” came Rolf’s hail from the prow.
“Pull, lads; ware rocks to the north. The passage
lies ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the sail lowered and much straining of
oars, they swung in past the rocky barriers where
the waves chafed and broke in foam. The great
cliffs towered upon either hand, solemn and
stupendous, tufted with dwarf oaks, topped with
pines. Once within the inlet, the galley ran
smoothly on the broad bosom of the river, whose
curves smote landwards into forest gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men rested on their oars while Tristan
climbed into the prow and stood beside Rolf the
seaman, looking forth over crag and forest. No
plume of smoke ascended to the sky, no roofs
shone out amid the green. The place was steeped
in the grandeur of solitude, and there was no
sound to break the silence save the perpetual plaining
of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan questioned the old man at his side; he
had grown grey under many winter skies over
stormy seas; his beard was as the foam below the
bluff beak of a ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whence comes this river?” he asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” he answered, “this great river feeds upon
the Seven Streams, and like a vast snake, takes
them all into its belly. We have entered in at
the sea gate of the land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are its rulers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, there are many lords in the land, holding
their fiefs direct from the King. Southwards lies
the duchy of La Marche Montagne, northwards
the duchy of Blanche the Bold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan pondered his words, as the river sped
past them to the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on,” he said, “and bear me higher into
the heart of the land. What better path for us
than this broad stream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed on that day the heights
descended, spreading eastwards into wooded hills.
The land grew milder and more green of face.
Ancient trees sentinelled the river; broad valleys
swept from it under the sapphire sky. Hills grey
with olives, dusky with cypresses and firs, rose
from green meadows, sleek and brilliant under the
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About noon, they rounded a rocky point, where
myrtles clambered up the bluff brow of the hill.
In the northern shallows they saw a boat moored
and a peasant fishing. As the galley drew near
with a steady pulse of oars, Tristan stood in the
prow and hailed the man over the water. The
fisherman fingered his line, and sat staring none
too trustfully at the galley sliding towards him
with ripples prattling at its prow. Strange ships
sailed seldom into those quiet waters; the bloody
deeds of Norse pirates still lived in the heart of
the peasantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, seeing the man’s distrust, tossed him a
piece of silver from the leather purse at his girdle.
The fisher groped for it amid the cordage at the
bottom of the boat. Questioned, he told them of
the knights and barons of those parts, of the
castles and hamlets therein, of the roads and forest
ways. His lord was a certain Sir Parsival, who
held a tower perched upon a neighbouring hill.
Lastly, he described the region known as La Vallée
Joyeuse, a rich and pleasant pasture land, where
vineyards purpled the hills, and Sir Ronan the
Peaceful had his home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, leaning on his sword, bade his men
pole in towards the northern bank, where a stretch
of meadowland swept to the myrtle thickets that
hid the rocks. The water lay still as glass in the
shallows. The woods cast purple shadows athwart
the stream, and the meads stood thick with many
flowers. The galley ran aground in a little inlet
where reeds and rushes bearded the bank. Tristan
leapt from the prow, found sure footing, and turned
with a smile to face his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good voyage and a clean sea to you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crowded to the bulwarks with many rough
and rugged prayers, holding up their caps to him,
proffering their service. Grizzled sea-dogs that
they were, they loved, him, even because he was
strong and generous, and a giant in arms. Like
Homeric mariners gathering round Ulysses at the
entry to Hades, they prayed him to share with
them the perils of the unknown. Tristan put them
off with bluff but unbending gratitude. They
would have hindered him, sea-dragons that they
were. Such a pilgrimage as his required but a
single sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good men that you are,” he said, buckling
his shield over his shoulders, “you ride the waves
better than the back of a horse. When I have
need of brown sails and a strong keel, I will send
to Purple Isle and call you over. To my sire and
to Dame Joan, my mother, commend me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tossed their rough blessings on him as
he climbed the bank, rattled the sweeps in the
rowlocks, waved their fur-lined caps. Tristan
saluted them with his drawn sword, a warm colour
on his ugly face. They were still watching him
and waving their brown fists when he disappeared
from their sight into the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a strenuous tone in the man’s stout
heart that day. The world lay open at his feet,
like a broad and glorious plain, unfolding its many
phases to his ken. Tristan, great boyish Titan,
with a heart of gold, welcomed the sun as it smote
through branches upon his face. He was glad of
the woods and of their solemn liberty, glad of the
hills, and the broad, beaming valleys. Purple Isle
had held him overlong in its girdle of foam. The
wide world smiled on him; the beacon of romance
burnt red upon the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed the path that morning that the
peasant had described to him, a path that wound
over uplands under the shadows of ancient trees.
The woods were virgin to Tristan’s heart. There
were no such broad-shouldered giants in Purple
Isle with its waving pines and stunted myrtles.
The great oaks stood to him for sinew and strength.
Their gnarled loins spoke of the sap of centuries,
their limbs of a hundred battles with the wind.
Youth ran riot in him that April day. He was
as a Bacchanal intoxicated with the wine of being.
He smote the great trees as he passed, bluff, open-handed
buffets that would have shaken a Hercules.
Once, in the joy of strength, he grappled an oak
sapling as he would have grappled a python,
wrestled with it, bent it beneath the might of his
broad back till the stem splintered and surrendered
to his grip. He tossed the broken tree aside with
the smile of a conqueror, strode on through the
woods, singing as he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come to the brim of a valley, and had
halted to gaze over the meadows with their dark
knolls of trees, when a shrill cry stirred him like
a wail of a hostile trumpet. Wild and inarticulate,
it eddied through the woods, terror breathing in
the cry, as of life struggling in the toils of death.
The voice grew and gathered, died again into an
eerie whimper. Tristan, stiff as a wooden image,
heard it with quickened pulses and a sudden
solemnity that overspread his countenance like a
cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pushing through a thicket of hollies, he came
to a great break in the woods, where the forest
gloom gave place to an open valley, a golden
bowl brimming with sunlight. In green meadows
a castle stood amid the windings of a stream.
Peace seemed throned above the olive thickets, the
shimmering water, and the gilded meadows. Yet
from a stone bridge that linked the sandy highway
where it crossed the stream, there rose other voices
to denounce the dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, standing under the woodshawe, beheld
a knot of figures swaying to and fro over the keystone
of the bridge. Swords were tossing, men
struggling together betwixt the parapets. The few
seemed caught and trampled by the many. Even
as he watched, a horseman broke from the pool of
grappling, foining figures, and galloped northwards
up the sandy road. An archer, standing on
the parapet of the bridge, loosed a shaft at the
fugitive, a shaft that found its billet in the rider’s
back. Tristan saw him thrust his arms to the sky,
twist in the saddle, and fall heavily to earth. His
horse, whinnying with fear, left the high road,
and cantered over the fields towards the thicket
where Tristan stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was not a youth given to the subtle
balancing of thought. Being barren of all fear,
save the fear of God, he obeyed without debate the
prick of impulse. Leaving the thicket, he hallooed
to the riderless brute trotting towards him over
the meadows. The horse halted, tossed up his head
with ears agog, pawed the earth as he cast about
from side to side. It was a superb beast, black
as a raven, with a single white star on the forehead.
Tristan called to him, advancing step by
step. There was a magic in the man that made
all wild things trust him and obey. The great
beast suffered him to approach over the grass.
Tristan’s hand touched the sleek, foam-flecked
muzzle. He caressed the brute’s ears, took firm
hold of the bridle, mounted at one spring, knew
himself the master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God helps him who helps himself,” he said,
with a certain quaint sententiousness, running his
fingers through the long black mane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being imbued, despite his strenuous vigour,
with some hard-headedness of discretion, he ignored
the blood-spilling in the valley, content to
shepherd the prize to his own good cause. Turning
back into the woods, he rode southwards from
the place, keeping diligent watch, however, lest
any hot-handed gentleman should be following on
his heels. Seemingly they were busied with the
purging of their own pastures, for Tristan saw no
more of them that day.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan le Sauvage slept that night in the woods.
He had discovered a flask of wine and a well-stocked
wallet slung to the horse’s saddle, an added
boon to the day’s capture. The air lay mild that
night as a June kiss on the earth’s round cheek.
Tristan, with his saddle propped against a tree,
and the stars glittering above the forest, fell asleep
thinking of Purple Isle and the far faces of his
kinsfolk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the first pulse of dawn in the east, he was
up and astir with the zest of the hour. The woods
were full of golden vapour, of dew and the chanting
of birds. A stream sang under the boughs,
purling and foaming over a broad ledge of stone
into a misty pool. A blue sky glimmered above
the glistening tree-tops; the dwindling woodways
quivered with the multitudinous madrigals of the
dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan went down and sprang into the pool.
He tossed and turned, smote wheels of spray with
his great arms, ploughed and furrowed the quaking
water. The blood leapt in him at the cold kisses
of the pool. Ruddy and buoyant, he clambered
out into the sunlight, his naked strength glistening
with the clean dew gotten of his swim. The
muscles rippled under the gleaming skin. Tossing
his great arms, expanding his deep chest, he ran
barefooted over the mossy grass. A drooping
bough swept low to tempt his fingers. He twisted
the limb from the trunk, tossed it like a lance from
hand to hand, leaping and glorying in the splendour
of his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anon, he armed himself, knelt down beside his
horse to pray. A quaint calm fell instant upon
his shoulders; the boisterous temper of his mood
sank like a sea beneath the benediction of a god.
It was in solitude, by sea or forest, that such a
man as Tristan opened his heart to Heaven. His
was not a soul that bartered through carved screens
for penitence and peace. His face caught a
radiance from the vaultings of the trees. St.
Cyprienne, with her dusky eyes and martyr’s
crown, received the woman’s portion of his prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had broken fast and watered his
horse at the pool, he sallied from the thickets with
the breath of the dawn beating upon his mouth.
Around him ran wooded hills, streams, and pastures
dusted thick with flowers. The odours of
spring burdened the breeze. In the distance the
purple of the heights that circled La Vallée Joyeuse
clove the azure of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tristan rode through the wilds that day,
following a grass-grown track that marked the
grave of a Roman road, he came to a little stone
shrine, standing by the wayside under the arms of
a granite cross. A larch thicket hedged the place
with a thin gloom. A fountain bubbled near,
oozing away amid green rushes and mossy grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the foot of the stone cross squatted a man
in a grey cloak, with a bell at his girdle and a
bag of undressed ox hide in his lap. Tristan stared
with unstinted but momentary disrelish at the
figure beside the shrine. The man was a leper,
and hideous even in the grip of a more than hideous
disease. His swollen and distorted face was grotesque
as some evil head carved by a mason’s
chisel. The brows were swollen over the watery
eyes, the mouth disfigured, the skin, mined by many
sores. Even the hands were cankered and deformed;
the man was as grim an image as misfortune
could display.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, out of sheer pity of heart, drew rein
to gaze at this outcast with furrowed brows.
Though the tide of youth ran strong in his body,
he was not the slave of that selfish health that
ignores despair and comprehends not pain. The
man by the cross held up his bag with a mute
gesture of appeal. Tristan, fumbling in the
depths of his purse, drew forth alms with a flash
of pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leper, keen to scent honour upon the thorny
track of life, gathered the tokens of charity from
the grass with hideous hands. He lifted up a
cracked and husky voice, blessed Tristan, and
wished him God-speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The holy saints defend you, messire,” he
said. “It is long since a Christian took pity on
my soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, ignorant of all leprous lore, and the
unsavoury nature of such a wanderer, questioned
him concerning La Vallée Joyeuse, and the length
of the road that led that way. This Lazarus was
very human under his thickened skin. Alms alone
did not dazzle his vision. The sick are ever hungry
for sympathy, the instinctive pity that shines from
the soul. The leper had as long a tongue as most
men, though the weapon had grown rusty for lack
of use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tread the road towards La Vallée Joyeuse,”
he said, rising from before the cross; “if a friend
will suffer my infirmities, I can play the guide for
a league or more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan climbed from the horse with a smile on
his face. There was no reflective pride within his
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mount up, friend,” he said; “my legs are
lustier than yours, I wager.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scorning debate in his masterful way, he held
the stirrup and heeled the man up. The black
horse snorted and tossed his mane, as though
despising so ragged a burden. Tristan ruled him
with hand and voice. If the master chose chivalry,
the beast could obey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this fashion they set out together, the leper
straddling the soldier’s horse, Tristan walking like
a groom at his side. They were soon accorded in
spirit and speech, for a smile on the lips makes
the whole world kin. The leper had lived as a
merchant in his day, till disease had beggared
him and left him an outcast. He had turned
pilgrim, so he said, to visit a certain holy well,
whose waters were magical to recover the sick.
The shrine lay by the northern seas. Many great
miracles had been wrought at this well, and pious
folk cleansed of many a malady. Of the Land
of the Seven Streams the leper had much to tell;
he had gathered shrewd gossip, as he travelled
north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good friend,” he said, when Tristan questioned
him, “I know neither the temper nor the
colour of your sword. If you carry a white heart
and travel for peace, I would pray you to beware
of La Vallée Joyeuse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, frank soul, unfolded without fear the
purpose of his quest. He told the man of Columbe
his sister, and of the vow he had sworn to recover
her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where the waves run white,” he said, “there
may the voyager find the wrecked ones who have
fallen in stormy waters. If this same valley is a
perilous region, who knows but that I may win
some news of my quest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend,” said the leper, with his hand on his
bell, “you misread the riddle. Listen, and I will
explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With honest despatch he uncovered to Tristan
the tone and temper of the Seven Streams. As he
told his tale that green spring day, his hoarse
raven’s croak made the theme more sombre, prophetic
of the clouds that shadowed the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have given me courtesy, messire,” he
said; “I return you good counsel, a rare commodity
when properly handled. The lords and peasant
folk of this same land have denied their faith to
our Great Father the Pope. They have taken
heresy into their hearts; have denied in the Sacrameant
the flesh and blood of our Lord. Even in
his wrath, the Pope was merciful, deeming them
ignorant and seduced by pride. He sent out his
legate and his missionaries into the land, but the
rude folk here would have none of their preaching.
So a crusade has been called against the
province, and swords are shining in the Southern
Marches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, rebel at heart, questioned the justice of
such a crusade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God’s light,” he said, “these priests are
over meddlesome with the souls of others. Tell
it not in Gath, my friend, but I have no great love
for men in petticoats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leper grimaced at him with his misshapen
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heresy or no heresy, messire,” he said, “they
have spilt holy blood here. I had the news on
this road this morning. The deed was done but
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” quoth Tristan, staring in the man’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have slain the Pope’s legate. God have
mercy on them, for the Church knows little of that
virtue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan remembered the wild cry in the woods,
the fight by the bridge, the slain man whose horse
he had taken. There was new significance in the
scene to him. He questioned the leper as to the
churchman’s end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old tale,” he said. “The priest trifled
with a certain knight’s daughter, whose tower
stands westwards towards the sea. There was
quick vengeance afoot. The knight and his men
followed fast after the legate’s company, ambuscaded
them, and put the whole rout to the sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God,” said Tristan, smiling in his eyes,
“they were well served for the deed. I would have
slain the Pope for a less dishonour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had passed a league or more in company,
and were crossing a heath open and bleak to wind
and sky. The leper reined in the horse on a
sudden, climbed from the saddle, gave the bridle
into Tristan’s hand. He drew his cowl down over
his distorted face, and trudged on wearily, like one
whose feet were weighted with despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore, messire,” he said, “you may gather
that there is like to be fire and sword in La Vallée
Joyeuse. As for me, my lamp burns dim; I must
cherish it that the good God may trim the flame
at St. Ursuline’s Well. Pray for one, messire,
who is often sad and heavy of heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend,” said Tristan, “my prayers are yours
for what they are worth. Doubt not that if
strength could cleanse you, you should be fresh
and clean as a new-budded rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to the rim of the sandy heath,
where the ground broke abruptly into rocky slopes,
plunging downwards under thickets of arbutus and
of pine. Four roads crossed at a spot where a
great wooden crucifix stretched out its painted arms
athwart the sky. The leper climbed a little knoll
rising from a pool of golden broom, and pointed
Tristan southwards over the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At their feet lay a great valley, a broad bowl
brimming with golden light. Its depths were
chequered with woods and meadows, pools set like
lapis lazuli in an emerald throne. A lake lay under
the shadow of the hills. Heights girded the valley
on every hand, save where a river like a giant’s
sword clove a deep defile through the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood silent in the sun, and gazed at the
valley under his hand. It was as a new world to
him; this rich cup of the earth, brimming with the
wine of beauty, sparkled with many colours in the
hand of Romance. The tall heights, the blown
cloud banners overhead, the dusky woods smiling
and frowning alternate under the sun, these were
as strange music to him, melting with many tones
into the purple distance of the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leper stood at his side in silence. He had
been watching Tristan’s face, with the bloom of
youth thereon, pondering the while on the misery
of his own hard lot. The world and the splendour
thereof mocked his shrivelled and repulsive skin.
As for Tristan, he seemed like a young god
destined to trample down fate with the serene calm
of a fearless fortune. The leper turned from the
warm south with the bitterness of a man who
beholds life’s pathway curling towards the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder, messire, is La Vallée Joyeuse,” he
said. “The saints defend you. As for me, I
wander on towards death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took leave of each other there; the leper
hobbling away with eyes down-turned, his bell
jangling at his thigh. Tristan, full of a great-hearted
pity, watched him with a smile upon his
mouth. He felt his own hale body warm to the
wind, his face fresh as dew-washed grass. The
man with his sores and his lonely despair loomed
like a dark cloud over the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan cast a last glance at him over his
shoulder as he descended the road. The leper had
drawn to the great cross where it towered solitary
under the open sky. He had fallen on his knees
at the foot thereof, and clasped the beam with
his arms. He was kneeling thus when Tristan left
him, clinging like a wrecked voyager to the feet
of the Christ.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rode on down the sandy road, pondering
what the leper had told him that morning concerning
Joyous Vale, how the valley lay in peril of
the sword. These priests, he vowed in his own
heart, were too given to meddling with the souls
of others. For a few subtilties twisted from a
theologian’s tongue, they would let war loose upon
an innocent province, and teach with violence what
they could not teach with truth. Tristan was not
a man who needed the superfluous unction of a
priest’s pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rounding a great rock that overhung the road,
he saw Sir Ronan’s hold smile up at him from
beside the lake. About the walls and terraces rose
many roofs, the ruddy hoods of many houses
gathered about their giant sire. The place looked
peaceful as a child asleep, bowered round with
green, touched by the waters of the lake. Pastures
pillared with poplars and aspens stretched towards
the darker confines of the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, glad in his heart of the beauty of it all,
followed the road where it plunged abruptly into
a thicket of pines. There was a patient gloom
under the sweeper boughs. Squirrels ran ruddy-coated
up the trees, peering black-eyed at him as
he passed, and gorse ringed the dark aisles with
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tristan rode through the pine wood that
day, he heard the sound of singing coming down
to him upon the breeze. It was a woman’s voice
that sounded through the woods, so richly that the
tall trees listened and smiled under the noon sun.
Tristan drew rein on the grass by the road. He
had never heard such a voice before, a voice that
set the welkin quivering as with vibrations of
tremulous light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Riding on again with a smile on his face, he
saw the woodland break away before the meadows
of the town. The sky grew broad above the trees,
and still the rich voice sounded through, now
hushed, now rising like a lark towards the clouds.
Tristan could catch the words of the song as he
walked his horse over the spongy turf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rounding a bank of furze in bloom, he saw
under the shade of a cedar tree a ruined shrine
grown round with thorns. Many flowers were
a-bloom in the grass, and a rivulet went splashing
down towards the great lake in the valley. A
gradual slope heaved away from the wood, and by
the shrine in the long grass a woman sat on a
fallen stone, with her face turned towards the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan dismounted, and, having tethered his
horse, he stood under cover of the bank of furze
and watched the woman by the shrine. She had
ceased her singing, like one whose thoughts were
too deep and solemn for further song. She was
sitting with her chin upon her palms, staring into
the distant south. Tristan saw the curve of her
neck, white and clear as the moon’s rim, the amber
of her netted hair, the rich folds of her green gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Tristan was not a woman’s man, and in
Purple Isle his ugly face had won him little favour
among the girls. He remembered how Grizzel, the
fishwife’s child, black of eye and red of face, had
mocked and taunted him on the moors, with her
bare-legged wenches at her back. He remembered
how he had wished them men for the sake of the
clods they had thrown at his head. Yet though
the woman by the shrine was as none of these, he
wavered a moment behind the bank, as though
half in awe of her because she was fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing his footsteps in the grass, she turned—and
saw him, and rose up from the stone. She
was as tall as Tristan, and older than he was both
in face and years and in knowledge of life. Her
golden hair was knotted up in a caul, her green
gown dusted with violets and bordered with blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed to shake the thoughts out of her
heart as she rose up and looked Tristan over.
Yet there was no aloofness in her eyes, nay, her
very soul seemed to shine therein as she stood
considering his face. She smiled a little as she
saw the bronzed, uncomely countenance somewhat
abashed and sullen before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you speak with me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was mute for the moment, like one
whose words stumbled one against each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are strangers,” she added, still smiling at
him out of her great eyes; “is my speech foreign
to your ears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was her complete fearlessness of
manner that smote Tristan from the first moment
that she spoke to him. An atmosphere of stateliness
seemed to surround her, an intangible magic
that held him despite his strength. Though he
could crush the brow of an ox with his fist, he
seemed half in awe of the woman whose face, with
all its fairness, showed no fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, squaring his shoulders,
“though a stranger here, your words are my
words. Tristan le Sauvage is my name, and I
have come from Purple Isle, over the sea. For the
rest, I have a quest upon me, and I carry a sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a species of defiance in his voice, as
though he viewed the subtler sex with a boy’s
suspicions. Nor was the meaning of his mood lost
upon the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matching frankness with simplicity, she gave
him welcome to the Land of the Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend,” she said, very openly, “welcome to
Joyous Vale, you and your sword. I, Rosamunde,
am the lady of this valley; you may see my
husband’s tower yonder, amid the trees. Our
guest table waits for strangers—who would tarry
for a season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan thanked her, and turned towards his
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am beholden to you,” he said, with that
rough shyness which gave to his face a certain
charm, “for in the Seven Streams I know no man
and am known of none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, when he had taken his horse, and joined her
by the ruined shrine, they passed down together
over the meadows towards the town.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan grew the more bewitched by the woman’s
face as they passed on towards the lake together.
The lips were thin, tinged slightly with scorn, yet
very tender when she smiled. The eyes were large
and of a greenish blue. There was a rich, round
beauty, upon the face, the rose tint of the skin
warm and sensuous as the bloom upon fruit. She
was very slim where the girdle ran, but big of
bosom and long of limb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was it the beauty alone that made Tristan
marvel. A sadness hovered there, a hidden meaning,
that his unlettered senses failed to fathom.
Mystery! Such the impress she gave to his
mind, like the tragic tone of some antique woe.
She seemed a woman to whom life should prove
sweet. Yet she had tasted of bitterness, so Tristan
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meadows rippled like golden cloth spread
under the trees for a queen to tread. A thousand
aspens shivered in the sunlight, their fluttering
melancholy chilling the air as with the sound of
rain. Poplars towered towards the blue. By the
lake stood a thicket of gnarled figs, their broad
leaves dappled over with gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, Lady of La Vallée Joyeuse, drew
Tristan’s tale from him as they walked the meadows.
Her swift simplicity was as a magic mirror,
wherein all creatures showed her their thoughts.
Tristan could but confess to her straight from his
soul as he looked into the unwavering depths of
her eyes. Not being burdened with the reflective
sense, he flung his words in the welkin’s face, with
the candour of one who had no shame to fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are but woodlanders here,” she said at the
end. “As for the wide world, we are walled from
its ken. This quest of yours troubles my knowledge.
To me, it is like seeking a solitary flower in
a trackless wild.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The darker the way, madame,” he answered
her, “the more splendid the quest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled suddenly, and her fine mouth softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the heart of youth in you,” she said,
“the heart that never tires on the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am strong, madame,” he said, very simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We women love strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And youth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me, youth is strength,” she answered, “age—weakness.
Only those are strong who keep their
hearts young. As for rusty age, it is the season
of discretion, of puling sapience, and unkindling
courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed to talk beyond the present, as
though her thoughts were high in the heavens.
Tristan could not tell what was in her heart, save
that she seemed sad, full of unrest. It was as
though her words were not for him, but for some
other soul in a far-off land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My life is my sister’s,” he said, with an air of
strength. “Though my hair grows grey, madame,
I shall seek her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy sister,” she said, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy brother,” he retorted, running his hand
over the horse’s black mane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan,” she said, with strange motherliness
in voice and mood, “there will come a day
when some woman will be happy with a heart such
as yours. If for a sister you will dare so much,
what will your faith be to one dearer than all the
sisters who tread the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to the town, sunk deep in
gardens beside the lake. Its roofs were ruddy as
an autumn orchard, its highways paved with white
stones; peace seemed to cover it, and great content.
No battlements frowned black-browed over
the meadows. Beauty and simple truth sat throned
in its calm heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Rosamunde, she was queen therein;
Tristan gathered as much before they had gone fifty
paces of the grey, white stones. Her empire lay
with the people’s hearts. She was mother, lady,
friend to all. Children ran to her when they saw
her face. She had a kiss, a smile, an outstretched
hand for each. Some brought her flowers, posies
of red and white, which Tristan, taking, laid within
his shield. The women beamed from doorways as
she passed. The peasants louted to her, warm
homage on their sun-tanned faces. She had a
word, a smile of sympathy for all. That they loved
her, Tristan could reason well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day, Samson comes to us,” she said to
those she passed, “to-night, friends, gather to the
castle. Samson will speak to us there. Bring with
you your children. They must share the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, forgetful of the mild eyes that stared at
him, a stranger in Joyous Vale, wondered in his
heart who Samson was. Perhaps a priest, a minstrel,
an arch-heretic. If these good folk were
apostates, he could praise their heresy. Sin,
poverty, and shame had little heritage in Joyous
Vale. He saw no beggars in the streets, no rags,
no misery, no unclean thing. The faces round him
were as fresh as May, serene and simple, harbingers
of good. If this same Samson had wrought
all this, surely of all men he could be counted
happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this wise, leading his black horse by the
bridle, Tristan came with Rosamunde to her husband’s
home. Tristan was not unloth to see this
Ronan, whose wife she was. One truth he had
gathered well: Columbe, his sister, was not in
Joyous Vale.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Many a year had passed since the rough folk of
the Seven Streams had first murmured against the
sleek and masterful priests whose god seemed the
god of wine-bibbing and of greed. Arrogance
and luxury and all manner of uncleanness had
spread through the abbeys of the land, staining
the robes of the Church with scarlet, tainting every
holy place. Charity had become as naught; lust
and avarice had walked hand in hand; tyranny
and violence had reigned together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus through many long years there had been
a great sundering of the sympathies of the people
from the tall towers and gorgeous palaces of the
Church. Not openly had the slow change come,
but with stealth, even as the earth’s crust is mined
by the tunnelling of subterranean streams. Celibacy,
that perilous plant, had cast its unclean
tendrils over the land, bearing dark fruit in many
a solemn haunt, making vain show, hiding the bane
beneath. Slowly all reverence had elapsed, and
fear had been swallowed up in hate. From the
broad lands and the dark forests teeming with wild
beasts, murmurings, like the moanings of the wind,
had spread and gathered through the Seven
Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Samson had come, like some tall demigod
out of the dark unknown. Was it not told that all
the wisdom of the East had been hoarded and stored
within his brain? The philosophic lore of Greece
was his. The sages of Egypt and the grey fathers
of the Church had poured their mystic learning
into his soul. Plotinus and Augustine, philosopher
and Christian patriarch, had mingled in him
their spiritual zeal. Half priest, half poet, half
soldier, and half seer, he had lifted his voice in the
Seven Streams, preaching Christ crucified, even as
the Galileans had preached of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him the rude instincts of the peasantry had
risen, eager and passionate, hungering for the
truth. Serf and lord had mingled in one cause.
Many a good married priest, condemned because
his heart was a father’s heart, had come to Samson,
zealous for the faith. Then the deep thunder of
the Great Pontificate had echoed over the streams
and mountains. Synod and council had dared the
strife; church and grave had been sealed up fast;
anathema and interdict had followed on. The dead
had been buried in unhallowed ground; the bread
and wine had been denied the land. Still Samson
had preached, so that the province followed him,
even till the great abbeys were empty and in ruins,
the shrines and churches given to the dust. So
fierce and turbulent had waxed the storm that monk
and priest had fled to the far south, fearing the
people and the people’s enmity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening when Tristan came to Joyous
Vale there was a gathering of the peasantry
on the castle terrace to hear Samson the Heretic
hold forth. He had ridden in towards vespers,
a big man, cowled and cloaked, on a gaunt grey
mare. By custom, a room had been set apart for
him in Ronan’s tower, to serve as an oratory and
cell. Here he could retreat like a hermit to his
cave, and refresh in solitude both the flesh and the
spirit, like the reasonable Christian that he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the terrace, the grey walls of the tower,
crusted with lichen, rose towards the azure of the
evening sky. A great silence covered the valley,
save for the bleating of sheep in the meadows, the
cry of the lapwing from the marshes. Distance
purpled the far horizon; the woods stood wondrous
green and fair. Peace prevailed over garden and
garth; as yet there was no muttering of war beyond
the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde sat in a great carved chair, draped
at the back with scarlet cloth. Ronan her husband
stood at her side. He was a lean man, with
prominent shoulders, shallow eyes, and a cold
mouth. The peasant folk sat on the benches before
them. Rosamunde’s women were at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had throned himself on the wall where
cactuses grew in urns of stone and gillyflowers
flourished, yellow and red. He was watching
Rosamunde and Ronan her lord. The man by the
chair pleased Tristan little. The hollow chest, the
sullen eye promised nothing virile in the matter of
arms. It puzzled Tristan how he had won such a
wife, for they were as a rose and a mandrake bound
up together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His cogitations were ended by the opening of
a door. Samson in his black robe came out on the
terrace. A wooden cross hung at his girdle; he
wore leather sandals and an iron chain round his
neck. Waving the peasant folk back as they
thronged him, he took a stool of cedar wood that
stood by the wall. Putting back the cowl from off
his face, he gazed round on those who awaited his
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though a seeming monk, he wore no tonsure;
the black hair was cropped close to the massive
head. Seated there in the western glow, he looked
like a Homeric hero with the face of a Jove. The
eyes were black, bright as polished stone. The
long jaw curved prominently under the thin,
straight mouth. The brows met in a black line
over the nose. A mass of passion and virile power,
he faced the peasantry like a prophet of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tristan watched him, he began to speak,
moving his hands to time his words. His voice
bewitched from the first sound, and the simple folk
before him were as still as stones. Even Tristan
forgot Dame Rosamunde’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson’s theme was simple and strong, yet
grand in its bold simplicity. He expounded the
pure spirit of the Christian creed, brushed aside
dogmas, denounced outward forms. His convictions
were great, his scorn as powerful. Greed in
high places, luxury and lust, pride and simony,
these were his victims. Casting Christ’s ideals
against the pomp of the Church, he mined the
rotten fabric with his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People of La Vallée Joyeuse,” he said, “clean
hearts avail with Heaven, clean souls, clean lives.
Labour in the fields is a prayer to God. Live that
you may not fear death; live that your lives may
demand entry into Heaven. Actions build the stairway
up to God, good deeds, pure thoughts. Believe
not those who promise you salvation with
hired prayers and the melting of much wax. Gold
cannot bribe God. The Church’s wings cannot
waft you into paradise if you are weighted with the
iron girdle of your sins. Pardons, penitences, the
ringing of bells, these are but mummeries to deceive
your souls. Serve God in your hearts, and you
will have no need of a Pope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s eyes had wandered from the preacher
to Rosamunde’s face. Its expression stirred him,
even as a falling star smites the vision of one
watching the night sky. The woman’s eyes were
fixed on Samson’s face, with a certain passionate
intentness that made Tristan wonder. The half-petulant
curve had vanished from her mouth. A
warm radiance seemed to burn upon her cheeks;
her eyes were more bright than the stones at her
throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By sudden instinct Tristan glanced at Ronan,
who stood beside Rosamunde, leaning on her chair.
The man’s narrow face was half in shadow. He
was watching his wife with a curious stare, fingering
his chin, his thin lips working. He appeared
to be studying the play of thought on her face,
shifting restlessly from foot to foot. More than
once he cast a rapid glance at the preacher, like the
glance a jealous hound casts at a rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Tristan there was a strange underchant to
the song, a secret movement he could not catch.
Samson’s eyes were on the people before him,
Rosamunde’s eyes on Samson’s face, Lord
Ronan’s on the face of his wife. Tristan watched
the three with his instincts groping in the dusk.
He listened no more to the preacher’s words, but
watched in silence the play before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had ridden low upon the hills. In the
gardens and thickets beneath the terrace a hundred
birds made their vesper song. Shadows, purple
and gold, increased on the lake. In the west, the
moon was heaving up a broad shoulder above the
world. A great silence descended like dew out of
the heavens. Odours of rose and myrtle flooded
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his vigil, Tristan woke to find the peasantry
moving, Samson standing alone by the wall.
The man had drawn down his cowl and re-knotted
his girdle. He passed back slowly towards the
door, walking gravely with his chin on his chest.
Tristan was watching Rosamunde’s face. He saw
her take a deep breath under her robe, her hands
hanging limp over the carved rails of her chair.
Her head seemed to droop on the scarlet cushion,
as she watched Samson under half-closed lids.
The town showed dim in the green gloom beneath,
like white coral glimmering under the sea. An
hour passed, and found Tristan on the terrace.
Far beneath the lake shimmered, touched by the
rising light of the moon. The cry of wild duck
came from the shallows. In the thickets a choir of
nightingales had broken the silence together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the terrace, Tristan had drawn beneath the
shade of a cypress, that rose like a spire from the
garden beneath. He was leaning his chin on his
crossed forearms, staring out over the scene. The
valley was as a battleground betwixt moonlight
and gloom. The hill-tops led the silver host on, the
water gleamed with the beat of their feet. In the
deeps of the woods and the hollows of the hills
the gloom kept the banners of the night unfurled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a rough melancholy in Tristan’s
mood. Samson’s words were as the noise of
swords dinning perpetually within his brain. A
vigorous zest breathed in the creed, a flash of the
green woods, a scent of the sea. The bold truths
of the man’s harangue were woven in his thought
like a crown round Rosamunde’s brow. Her large
eyes haunted him, wistful and brave. He remembered
also her husband’s face, with its lack-lustre
malice, its cold distrust. There was some romance
in this heretical crown with the great stones set in
its band, the treacherous opal scowling yellow and
green, the sapphire blue and bold in the sun, the
ruby red with its passionate fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two voices came to Tristan out of the gloom,
as he loitered on the terrace under the stars.
Hunching his shoulders, he drew towards the tree.
The voices came from the garden below, where
there was a yew walk by the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first voice was Rosamunde’s; Tristan
caught the mellow tones out of the dark. Anger
flooded it, to judge by its temper. A second voice
echoed the woman’s, a cold drawl, vain yet bitter.
It was the Lord of Vallée Joyeuse who walked with
her under the yews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I may claim some reverence from
you,” came the taunt. “God knows, I am only
your husband; a poor reason, it seems. This
braggart preacher bulks too large in our house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a man, messire. You are jealous, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You suggest, madame wife, that there is cause
for the passion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence held a moment, a pause as for breath.
Tristan’s mouth hardened. It was the woman’s
voice that sounded next, a ringing scorn in it that
made Tristan’s eyes glitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is marriage a surety for insolence?” it said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Insolence! Is the truth insolent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I suffer this, though I am your wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Husbands, madame, suffer no tricking of their
honour, save when they are blind bats and fools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was again a pause. Rosamunde’s words
came clear and passionate as the notes of a well-tuned
harp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, you have said enough to me, though you
are my mate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Regret it, madame, as much as you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But beware of trickery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These lies, I’ll not brook them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cultivate discretion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence! I am no puppet, though you have
wedded me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voices passed westwards under the yews,
growing faint as the angle of the terrace came
between. Tristan stood up, and spread his broad
shoulders. There was an ugly look in his eyes, a
firm closing of his iron mouth. He tightened his
sword belt, passed from under the stars to the hall,
spoke little as he sat at supper with Ronan’s men.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Seven days had passed, and Tristan was still
lodged under Rosamunde’s roof. Of his sister
Columbe he had won no word, yet he tarried in
Joyous Vale in Rosamunde’s service. The woman
had need of a loyal sword. Tristan had learnt to
serve her there with the quick instinct of a great-hearted
dog. There was much of the mother in her
mood towards the man; nor did she dower his face
with any deeper passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shadows had deepened round Joyous Vale, and
vague rumours had come from the south, whisperings
of sword and torch and the march of armed
men. A shepherd had seen dim sails upon the sea.
As to what summer would bring to them, prophecy
stood silent. Rosamunde’s state was no
easy one, as Tristan had gathered, for she was
watched and spied upon by her husband’s men.
Ronan’s jealousy was as a snake coiled in the grass,
ready to dart and flesh its fangs. She could no
more trust him than she could trust a priest.
Moreover, his malice hindered her cause, barred
her from plotting to save her people. Samson
alone could help her in this, and Ronan’s jealousy
kept the two apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning of Tristan’s second Sabbath
there. He was on the terrace burnishing his arms,
when Isabel, Rosamunde’s woman, crept out to
him from the tower. He was to take horse and
follow her lady that morning. She had need of
him, and trusted his honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, having saddled and bridled his horse,
rode out and met Rosamunde at the gate. She
was mounted on a white palfrey, her woman Isabel
beside her on a mule. Tristan saluted them, a
silent discretion in his deep-set eyes. To him
Rosamunde’s beauty was as the breath of June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode out down the slope of the hill, where
the gardens amid the thickets were ablaze under
the noon sun. Rosamunde was clad in a green
robe, with a girdle of red leather shaped to her
figure. She rode on before Tristan and the woman
Isabel, as though not sorry of solitude and freedom
from stone walls. There was a calm unapproachableness
about her, which, when she so willed it,
became as a wall of glimmering ice. Her words,
often imperious and curt, would have suggested
insolence on the lips of one less fair. Tristan had
seen her angered but once. There had been something
of the splendour of a stormy sunset about the
mood, a red rush of passion that had bewitched
him more than smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they left the town behind a screen of poplars,
Rosamunde called Tristan to her, but gestured
Isabel to remain behind. Her lips had much scorn
on them that day, scorn for her husband, jejune
and jealous pedant that he was. Of the red wine
of her love Lord Ronan had tasted little. She was
unsmirched as a rose, pure as an ivory palace
conceived in some deep dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan eyed her over his massive shoulder,
wondering much what was in her heart. A mask
of thought covered her face, as she gazed ahead
into the deeps of the woods. True, there was
much in her heart to breed unrest, yet Tristan was
as a child in a temple, ignorant of the many and
manifold visions stirring within her brain. La
Vallée Joyeuse stretched out before her, like a
calm sea untouched by the wind. Yet beyond the
mountains the black banners of war gathered.
Fanaticism was streaming like fire to purge and to
destroy. Had not the Pope armed the southern
nobles against the land? Had not Sir Parsival
put his legate to the sword?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, great lady that she was, feared not
for herself the peril of a zealot’s war. The people
of La Vallée Joyeuse were to her as children. She
was their lady, and they loved her, even because
she was gracious and merciful, a friend set above
them like an altared saint. It was her spirit that
had opened their rude hearts to Samson’s heresy.
She, the first convert in mind and soul, had drawn
them after her, as a shepherdess draws her sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the lords and barons of the Seven
Streams, they were scattered wide amid their woods
and hills. Samson had preached and they had
listened. Mewed in their mountains and their
forest gloom, they were deaf to the thunder of
ecclesiastic wrath. Ronan of Joyous Vale, first
lord of the province, was mere selfish clay, careless
of his people, jealous of his wife. His very malice
made her mute to him. On Samson, rugged Titan
piling mountains against the Papal Jove, rested the
one ambition of the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drawing Tristan to her that day, Rosamunde
unbosomed something of her care to him. There
was a serene stateliness in all her words, a tender
dignity as of one who stoops, from love, not pride.
The man seemed nothing but a casual friend,
cast in her path by the hand of circumstance. She
trusted him, had trusted from the first, because his
face was ugly and his words came slow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan gathered the truth from her as they
rode through the meadows. There was much
shrewdness in his turbulent brain. Moreover,
Rosamunde had taken hold upon his heart. Sympathies
are warm where love treads fast; comprehension
kindles when the torch burns bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady,” he said to her, in his curt, calm way,
“of the burden you bear—I am wise—in measure.
Our cross bulks the heavier when the shoulder is
chafed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she said, with a flash of the eye, “these
valley folk are as children to me. I have no babe
of my own, so the burden is honest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan recalled such war lore as he had learnt
from the rough mariners of Purple Isle. He would
have served her more gladly with his sword than
with his tongue. She had tempted his counsel; he
bent his brows and played the philosopher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, “I have heard men say
that our fears are like hillocks seen through mist,
bulking like mountains through the fog. I have
found billows less big when I have breasted them.
As for this land of yours, it is a maze of mountains
and of woods. You can baulk your enemies, as
King David baulked Saul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She plucked the strategy from the speech like
a gem out of a casket, and played with it to her own
good comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To leave our homes,” she said, “and take to
the wilds. There is wisdom in the plan, and
yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan attempted more stoical counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better let your homes burn than your bodies,”
he said. “Scattered and in hiding, you will provide
no martyrs for these holy ravagers. They will
return empty by their own tracks. Ten men are
worth a hundred in the mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she said, with sudden passionate scorn,
“if I could but trust my husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust yourself, madame,” quoth the man on
the black horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One staunch friend perhaps. What then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, full of the ready zeal of youth, set forth
his faith to her with a gesture of the hand. He
went red under his black brows, as though half
ashamed of such an outburst of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said to her, “here is one sword
more. I am young—you smile, by God—I have
the strength of three. No man in Joyous Vale
shall laugh twice in my face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan,” she said with deepened colour,
“I trust you well. Why should I burden you with
another’s yoke? What is Joyous Vale to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said very simply, “my shoulders
are broad; try them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day, I trust you,” she retorted slowly.
“We meet Samson in yonder wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lines ran across Tristan’s broad forehead; his
mouth hardened. He was as a man who felt himself
outfaced, disarmed. There was no guile
towards him in the woman’s heart, and yet his
youth recoiled from her with jealous spleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said half sullenly, looking no
longer on her face, “I have promised faith to you.
It is enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before them rose a great barrier of trees, a larch
wood set upon the green bosom of a hill, whose
slopes fell away towards a vague wilderness of
pines. Many flowers and herbs were in bloom
upon the hillside. Tristan, sullen of face, drew
apart from Rosamunde as they mounted the slope
and entered the alleys of the deepening wood.
The sun poured through, streaking and ribbing
the gloom with gold. Rosamunde’s green gown
gleamed richly above her palfrey’s white flanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deeper and deeper they threaded the shade,
the grass track growing less green, dusted with
cones and the fallen wind wrack of the trees.
Whortleberry and heather grew there, with great
pools of gorse. The silence increased, hanging
like a purple pall, the sunlight plashing fitfully
over the multitudinous boughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep in a dwindling aisle, they saw a man in
a black robe seated upon a fallen tree. He rose,
came towards them, when he marked the white
brow of Rosamunde’s horse. Tristan, watching
the woman’s face, a half-jealous gleam deep in his
eyes, saw the colour increase the rose-white richness
of her skin. She breathed more rapidly, held
her head higher, watched Samson keenly as he
came towards her under the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drawing near, he put his cowl back from his
face, kissed the hand she stretched to him, held
her stirrup while she dismounted. She cast her
bridle over Tristan’s wrist, threw a rapid glance
at him as he sat hunched and sullen upon his
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” she said with an imperious tone tinging
her voice, “watch, keep guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, turning with a word, took the white
palfrey and his own black horse, tethered them
to a tree on the eastern side of the ride. Isabel
had joined him on her mule, a smile on her broad
mouth as she noted the man’s sour face. Samson
and Rosamunde were pacing the grass together,
looking in each other’s eyes as they talked. There
was much on either tongue, question and counter-question,
words as to the war and the gathering
in the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman Isabel had slipped lightly from her
mule. She was a plump, yellow-skinned wench,
with roguish eyes and a red patch of colour over
either cheek-bone. Her tongue was equal to her
temper. Tristan, leaning against the trunk of a
tree, paid no heed to her as he stared at Samson
and the lady. The man’s stride spoke of his
power; he gesticulated as he talked, and his words
flowed fast. Rosamunde’s green gown swept the
grass in stately fashion. She walked with arched
neck and supple waist, her hair glimmering under
its golden net, her red-slippered feet gliding glibly
over the turf. Tristan gazed at her and marvelled.
For the moment he half hated her for her loveliness
and for the calm pride that kept him chained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He awoke to find the woman Isabel at his elbow,
peering with parted lips into his face. She smiled
in her eyes as they met his, touched her mouth
with a fat white hand, moved nearer to him with
a little rustle of a sigh like a summer breeze
through orange bloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coz, we are well sorted,” she said with a
titter. “A silver cross for your thoughts, boy.
Why so sour of face?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan scowled at her betwixt the brows, and
unbent nothing to her coquetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, cousin,” he said, “men find the moon dull
when the sun is away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sun!” she retorted, “you ugly stump! Keep
your eyes wide. I am too bright for such as
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shine hard,” he said to her with a smile. “I
shall have no need of a shield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tightened her girdle, smoothed her gown,
and eyed Tristan under drooping lids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson is a handsome fellow,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan pursed up his mouth and answered her
nothing. Rosamunde and the preacher had passed
deeper into the wood, and were out of sight and
hearing. Tristan would have given much to have
known what passed between them under the
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson,” said the girl at his elbow, “Samson,
sirrah, has the wit to be courteous to a lady. He
has no tongue like a tag of undressed leather, nor
a face like a dinted buckler red with rust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan played with the buckle of his sword belt
and wished the woman Isabel a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, cousin,” she ran on, “I have heard of a
horse-boy stealing a pair of red shoes, because
they had covered a lady’s toes. As for her heart,
it was a pearl, a great white pearl, sirrah, not to
be breathed upon and handled by grooms. Hark!
holy saints, what’s amiss in the wood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel had started from her malice like a woman
who sees a snake twisting at her feet. She stood
rigid, with eyes dilating, her lips apart, the colour
gone from her face. Through the alleys of the
wood had come a sudden outcry, the loud voice of
a man challenging a foe, the passionate declaiming
of an angry woman. Tristan, with his back taut
as the straining mast of a ship, stood snuffing the
air, his muscles quivering, his broad chest spread.
In the flash of a second he had plunged down the
grass ride at a run, unbuckling his sword as he
ran, flinging aside belt and scabbard. Voices,
passionate and clamorous, were playing through
the trees. They winged on Tristan’s heels, as he
sped with tight mouth and kindling eyes under
sun and shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming upon a narrow glade in the wood, he
saw the scene spread out before him. With her
back to a tree stood Rosamunde, her eyes ablaze,
her head held high. Before her, with uplifted
knife, his robe gathered as a buckler in his left
hand, stood Samson the Heretic, fronting four
armed men who crouched round him like hounds
about a boar. Even as Tristan came, they sprang
together upon the monk, dragging him down in
a moiling heap upon the grass. The fourth
snatched out at Rosamunde, caught the neckband
of her gown, rent it to the girdle as she strained
from him with both hands set upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan leapt in as though his blood had
changed to fire. The man who had seized on
Rosamunde sprang away with a red throat and
an empty doom. Turning, Tristan plunged upon
the three, who struggled and writhed over the
powerful figure of the priest. Plucking the uppermost
by the girdle, even as he would have plucked
a beetle from a stone, Tristan threw him full
against the stem of a tree. The man’s breath
groaned out of him; he twitched and lay still.
Samson, bleeding in the brow, had risen upon the
others with a hand on either throat. Tristan,
dodging round, ran his sword through the body of
the taller man. Samson, bleeding and breathless,
rose from the carcass of the other, and made way
for Tristan’s blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sudden silence fell upon the pool of death.
Rosamunde stood with Tristan and the monk, staring
at the brief havoc their hands had wrought.
The grass was stained with red. Samson, shaking
the blood out of his eyes, turned to Tristan with
outstretched hand. Their manhood seemed to meet
in that one strong grip. Rosamunde, tearing cloth
from the border of her gown, came forward and
caught Samson by the sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monk knelt to her while she bound the
green cloth about his forehead. Tristan stood apart
from them, his eyes still ablaze, his great chest
rising and falling beneath his hauberk. Jealousy,
quenched for the moment, rose again in the hot
blood that played about his brain. Turning upon
his heel with a last glance at the man lying against
the tree, he strode away towards the horses, where
the woman Isabel stood with a face white as swan’s-down.
To her querulous terror he gave no heed,
for there was still bitterness gnawing at his heart.
If he had been the wounded one, would Rosamunde
have rent her gown?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some minutes passed before she came towards
them under the trees. She came alone, pale and
distraught, yet cold outwardly as stone. Samson
had parted from her in the woods; their words
had been brief, significant as silence. She said
nothing to the two who waited; pointed them to
their saddles, and neither dared to question her,
so imperious and clouded was her face. Then
they mounted, rode out, and headed homewards
over the fields.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, pale and silent, rode through the
thickets that clothed the castle hill. Not a word
had she spoken either to Tristan or to Isabel since
she had parted with Samson in the wood. Her
face seemed frozen into an unnatural calm, as
though she strove to mask the passions that worked
within. There was a deeper significance in the adventure
than either Isabel or Tristan had imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wound through the gardens where the
sunlight slept upon the lawns, and came through
a myrtle thicket to the great gate. The place was
deserted, steeped in the noon silence. Tristan,
clattering in at a word from Rosamunde, woke a
groom sleeping on a bench in the stable court, and
sent the man out to take the horses. Rosamunde
stood under the shadow of the gate. There was
an angry calm upon her face, a statuesque scorn
that seemed to prophesy of what should follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me—be silent, both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were her only words to them as she
turned towards the terrace, white above the green
gardens spread below. At the entry of the passage
leading to the great hall and the tower she turned
on Tristan and Isabel with a rapid stare from her
unwavering eyes. There was deep meaning in
that glance of hers. Tristan felt it, even as a bolt
piercing his hauberk. With it she challenged his
faith, his loyalty towards her as a woman. Laying
a finger on her lip, she beckoned them to
follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following in silence, they passed the gallery,
climbed a short stair, found themselves in a dark
entry set back in the thickness of the wall. A
streak of light showed where a door stood. Rosamunde,
lifting the latch, peered in and entered.
Tristan and the woman followed her. They could
hear nothing else save each other’s breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long room stretched with lessening shadow
towards a tall window opening on the south, and
hangings, green and gold, covered the walls.
Eight carved pillars ascended towards the dark
vault above. At a table near the window sat a
man with his back turned towards the door; the
table was littered with fragments of glass, colours,
brushes, and illumined scrolls. The man by the
window was bending over a glass panel, enamelling
a red rose thereon with unsteady hand. He
seemed oblivious of the three who watched him
from the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, with her torn robe gathered in her
hand, moved into the room, with a glance thrown
at Tristan over her shoulder. Following, he stood
behind her in the shadow, watching her every
movement. She gestured to him to strike one of
the pillars with the scabbard of his sword. As
the clangour sounded through the room, the man
by the table twisted on his chair, sprang up and
stared at them, dropping his brush on the stone
paving at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a significance in the scene, tinged
as it was with the love feud of these two. Rosamunde,
tall as a white lily, stared the man down
with an imperious scorn that betrayed the truth.
Tristan, watching the Lord of Joyous Vale as he
would have watched a wolf, saw him pale under
his brown hair before the damning figure of his
wife. His eyes wavered, his jaw fell. He seemed
to stoop, to contract, as a tree shrivels before the
breath of a forest fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, still gazing on his face, advanced
towards him across the room. The man would
have fallen back before her had not the table
barred his way. Her splendid height, her towering
courage, seemed to cast into contrast his
cringing guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, thanks to Heaven, we have returned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was so suggestive a scorn in her voice
that the high roof seemed to quiver at the sound.
Ronan, moistening his dry lips, frowned and found
no answer. The poor smile that he conjured up
was as a moonbeam flitting over ice. His blood
ran cold; he was afraid, and showed his fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, we have returned,” she said with the
slow torture of an unpitying tongue. “For your
good welcome, husband, we give you thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man bowed to her stiffly, clumsily, like a
wooden doll jointed at the hips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame is ever welcome,” he said; “her
prerogative demands it. Need I emphasise the
truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed at his words, a laugh that seemed
as foreign to her beauty as the cracked cackle of
some shrivelled hag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, your courtesy bribes me to silence. I
see we but hinder you; trifle with such lordly
cares as befit your temper. Pick up your brush,
sir. Playing with crafty colours upon brittle glass,
the pastime pleases you. I would commend it to
a man of courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes flashed for the moment, grew dull
again like treacherous water. He reached for the
brush, to hide his face from her. Rosamunde,
gathering her green gown, swept by him with
scorn. At the door she turned and cast a last
taunt at him over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson the Heretic is well,” she said. “He
sends you, sir, his great good will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that noontide Tristan stood on guard at the
door of Dame Rosamunde’s room. She was as a
white bird in the nest of a snake, and for all his
jealousy Tristan’s blood ran loyal in her service.
They were Ronan’s men who had fallen upon
Samson and Rosamunde in the wood that day. The
Lord of Joyous Vale was no open and courageous
smiter, for poison suited his senses better than an
honest blow. That Rosamunde was in great peril
Tristan le Sauvage knew right well. It seemed
that his one buckler covered her from the world,
nor was he sorry to sustain the feud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, keeping guard before the door, watched
the sun sinking towards the western hills. The
light smote through the narrow casement in the
rough stone wall, played and gleamed upon the
laced rings of his hauberk. There were warring
instincts in the man’s heart. Jealousy still stirred
in him. Yet over his finer self there shone that
luminous reverence for a woman’s name. Tristan,
half savage, half Christian in his untempered
youth, strove with his deepening manhood towards
the finer faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the gold mellowed in the west, the woman
Isabel came out to him from her lady’s room.
The morning’s adventure had sobered the wench’s
mood; she had dropped her coquetry at her mistress’s
feet. Drawing Tristan in, she barred the
door, stood by it listening, pointed the man into
an inner room. He noted the great bed with its rich
hangings, the carved panels, the coloured cloths
about the walls. There was a rich and mysterious
savour in the air; even the flowers upon the casement
ledge seemed brighter than their fellows in
the fields below. To Tristan the place was as
some rare shrine, whose odours and gleaming dyes
breathed about the face of Love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde sat at the open window looking
towards the lake. A bank of gillyflowers bloomed
upon the sill. There was still the same proud
pallor upon the woman’s face; solitude had not
bribed her to salve her care with tears. Hers were
not eyes that wept at the first kiss of anger or
of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning, she looked long at Tristan, like one
who would be sure of the faith she needed. The
man’s shoulders were broad; they might bear her
honour. Woman that she was, she was the more
eager for his comradeship, since jealousy had
snatched at the red jewel over her heart. No doubt
she thought it easy for the man to serve her, seeing
that she imagined no bitterness upon his ugly
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, looking deep into his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met the glance squarely, like one sure of
his own honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, to-day I have trusted you,” she said;
“this morning you promised faith to me. I would
try you further. Am I wise in this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said with blunt simplicity, “you
are apt at making servants. I obey you still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose, stood at the window, pointed him to
the lake. Tristan drew to her side, gazed out as
she told him of her charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, there is an island yonder, covered with
trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan bent his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are boats on the strand below the town;
go alone and ferry over. On the island there is a
ruined chapel. By the altar, under the ambry in
the right-hand wall, you will see a stone marked
with a trefoil in the floor. Under the stone there
lies a casket of black oak. Take the casket; sink
it in the deeps of the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gazed into each other’s eyes questioningly,
like two mutes over a grave. Rosamunde
was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you will take oath to me?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my sword, madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The casket goes unopened to the deeps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, I am content.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood forward suddenly, and stooping a
little, kissed him upon the brow. It was done in
a moment, but the shaft had sped. Tristan, red
to the lips, went back from her with a strange
light in his eyes. He was hers from that moment,
body and soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sinking sun had built a golden highway
over the water when Tristan came to the lake’s
rim. The woods stood wondrous green against
the sombre purple of the hills, and the reeds and
rushes glittered like silver wire. Water-fowl
winged from out the shallows as he unmoored a
boat that lay half grounded by a stone stage.
Thrusting out and setting the water spinning at
the prow, he was soon deep in the golden pathway
towards the west. Two furlongs away the
island cast its gloom upon the lake. The water
lay black and deep about its rocks; the stunted
trees were bannered with crimson and gold.
Tristan was soon under their shadows, where he
ran the boat aground in a small inlet, clambered
out, and sought the chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place stood ruinous, plunged deep in
weeds, festooned with ivy and many lusty plants,
choked thick with brambles. A fallen pine tree
lay across the roofless porch. Briers and nettles
cumbered the floor. Tristan, struggling through
in the half gloom, had to draw his sword where
the chancel began. A great thorn tree flourished
betwixt the roofless walls. Tristan clove a pathway
through the prickly mass, trampled the nettles,
climbed the low steps towards the altar. Crouching,
he sought for Rosamunde’s stone. It was
some while before he tore the rank herbage aside,
and found the trefoil carved beneath. The slab
had been glued by damp and moss. It was smooth
and heavy, giving no vantage to his fingers.
Working with the sword point, he prised up the
stone, thrust in his hand, and drew the casket out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night had fallen and the west drew dim.
Hardly had he huddled the casket into his bosom,
turned back the stone over the hole, when an
uprush of gruff voices rose as from the dark
thickets of the place. Tristan, starting up with
twitching sword, fell back against the altar, alert
and grim. The plash of churned water broke on
the evening silence, the creaking of sweeps in the
rowlocks. Scrambling out towards the gate,
Tristan saw the tall mast of a ship stride black
across the sky. It skirted the island, towering
over the trees, a scarlet streamer afloat from its
gilded vane. Like a great finger it seemed to
stretch towards the sky, held aloft as in silent
warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Threading the thickets with the oaken casket
under his arm, Tristan came to the island’s rim.
He looked over the water towards the west, and
saw that the lake seemed peopled with shadowy
ships, striding solemn and silent out of the night.
A thousand oars seemed to churn the water.
Bulwarks glimmered, armour shone. Like giant
ghosts the ships crept on, sable and strange
against the fading west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sudden out of the gloom leapt the cry of a horn,
its voice echoing from the hills. A vague clamour
came from the shore. In the town, torches were
gleaming like red moths in a garden. From the
castle the alarm bell boomed and clashed, for the
Papal fleet had descended on Joyous Vale.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, made his way back to the boat, poled out
from the island, keeping its black shadows betwixt
him and the nearest galley. He rowed eastwards
into the open cavern of the night, his eyes roving
from the distant town to the great ships stealing
over the water. Their tall masts rose against the
last gleaming cranny in the west. Beyond them
the mountains towered solemn and stupendous,
fringed with aureoles of transient fire. Even in
the half gloom Tristan could see a vague glittering
movement on the slopes behind the castle, a
glitter that told of armed men marching from the
hills. It grew plain to Tristan, as his broad back
swung with the oars, that the Pope’s men had
come by sea from the Southern Marches, sailed
up the great river, landed troops in the woods,
struck a sudden blow at the chief lord of the
province of the Seven Streams. While Ronan had
grown drunk with the strong wine of jealousy,
Death had descended upon Joyous Vale, and
sprinkled the Cross with the blood of sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a swirl of thought in Tristan’s brain.
Rosamunde of Joyous Vale had his mind in thrall,
and his first duty to her was easy in its consummation.
Leaning his chest upon his oars, he reached
for the casket where it lay on the plankings at
his feet. The thing was bound with iron, its
wood black and ponderous with age. Tristan
balanced it in the hollow of his hand, wondering
whether it would sink or swim. The feminine
temptation to force the lid never thrust a suggestion
into his brain. Tossing the casket over the
gunwale, he saw it sink in a wavering circle of
light. For fully a minute he watched the place,
that he might be assured of the casket’s burial.
With the vow to Rosamunde fulfilled, he turned
both his thoughts and his boat towards the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ships had lighted flares upon their prows,
a crescent of fire that deepened towards the town.
Many of the galleys had touched the shore;
Tristan could hear the crews shouting and plashing
in the shallows, as they disembarked to attack
the town. Behind the poops of the ships deep
gloom prevailed, while a cresset glared on the
castle tower, a red tuft of flame gemming the night.
The bell still tolled. It ceased of a sudden; the
silence was more sinister than its clangour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan pulled for the bank where a thicket of
larches rose near the water. Climbing out, he
splashed through the shallows, moored the boat to
the stump of a tree. Strenuous stanzas were astir
in his brain. What of Rosamunde in her husband’s
tower? Swords were yelping about the
place, torches tossing, spears aslant. Could
Samson the Heretic save her now? It was the
sword’s turn, and Tristan rejoiced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the wood, he crossed the meadows
that ran to the dark roofs of the town. There
was no wall or ditch about the place; the streets
could be swept by a charge of horse. A whimpering
uproar rose towards the stars; there was
fighting afoot. Tristan soon gathered as much.
Going at a trot over the meadows, he blundered
suddenly on a knot of armed men, a Papal picket
guarding the road. So intent were they on watching
the town that Tristan fell flat, and escaped
unseen. The men wore white crosses over their
hauberks, a blazoning adopted to distinguish their
cause. Tristan, plunging on into the gloom, won
a stretch of garden ground that dipped towards
the meadows. Flowers bloomed pale-faced in the
dusk. The scent of thyme and roses burdened
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Papal levies had ended the tussle as
Tristan gained the fringe of the streets. Houses
were ablaze in the western quarter, flinging a red
canopy over the town. Swords and pikestaffs
swirled in the streets. Bronzed, sweaty bravos
were looting the houses, letting lust loose in attic
and cellar. Now and again a quick scream wavered
from some darkened house, a scream followed by
oaths and unclean laughter. Women and children
in their nightgear ran headlong into the streets,
to be hounded down and taken, or driven away
into the woods. Now and again there was a
scuffle, as men met and fought out the death feud
in doorway and in garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, passing up an alley under the deep
shadow of a wall, ran full face into the arms of
a soldier who came stumbling out of a hovel with
a wine skin under his arm. Seeing the white cross
on the man’s chest, Tristan seized so kindly a
chance. His great arms went round the man like
the coils of a python. The wine skin burst under
their feet as they struggled by the wall. Tristan
lifted the soldier shoulder high, dashed him down
on the cobbled path, where the man rolled on his
side, lay still in the shadow. Tristan, kneeling
down, unlaced his surcoat, stripped it off, and
tumbled it over his own head. The white cross
would serve him as well as his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road towards the castle teemed with steel,
and torches flared through the thickets. The castle
walls started pale and fitful out of the gloom, their
battlements gleaming above the gardens dark
under the stars. A hot burst of cheering came
down into the town. The troops thronging the
road shouted in answer, as they pressed on to
share in the sacking of the place. Clarions blew
a triumphant fanfare. The strident chant of a
company of white monks rose from the market
square. They were singing a “Gloria” as they
wound in procession through the town, a great
cross and a silver reliquary borne in state before
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had joined himself to a company of
archers who followed a knight in a green surcoat,
bearing a scarlet leopard on his shield. They
came by the black thickets and the silvery lawns
to the broad entry of Sir Ronan’s hold. A bunch
of pikemen held the gate, where broken beams told
of the late assault. Three dead men lay by the
guard-room door, slain there when the gate had
crashed down. Tristan shouldered in with the
rest, unquestioned since he wore the white cross
on his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great court was packed from wall to wall.
The Papists had dragged a horse-block into the
midst, and were beheading such of the garrison
as had escaped unscathed in the fight. Tristan
saw a mere boy dragged forward by the wrists,
forced down on the block despite his screaming.
The fair hair was soon dabbled in blood. Near
by stood a tall ruffian with a severed head on his
spear. Even in the torchlight Tristan knew the
face, for it was Ronan’s head on the soldier’s
lance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shuddering still at the thought of the lad’s
screams, he pushed on towards the terrace with
the green knight’s men. His massive shoulders
gave him the van. There was a great press in
the gallery to the hall, as those on the terrace
jostled in towards the door. Cries of “Back, sirs,
back! reverence for the Lord Bishop,” echoed
under the low-pitched roof. Tristan, putting brute
force to good use, thrust his neighbours to the
wall, the men’s oaths falling like water from his
broad back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within, the hall was lit by flambeaux, borne
by the guards about the wall. Grim, iron-shirted
men packed the place, their surcoats turned up
over their girdles, their swords bare to the red flare
of the torches. In the waist of the hall a grove
of spears tapered towards the smoke-wrapped
rafters, their points like dim stars seen through
clouds. Before the daïs had gathered a great company
of knights and captains, ranged in long ranks
against the walls. The many painted shields,
azure, green, and red, shone in a rich array under
the gloom-filled roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the daïs in dead Ronan’s chair sat a man
in a robe of black velvet, a gold cross hanging
by a chain about his neck. He wore a cap of
purple silk over his tonsured scalp. There were
jewelled rings upon his plump white fingers; he
had a belaced and perfumed diaper in his lap.
At his right hand sat a burly lord with a black
beard and a face of iron, Benedict, Warden of
the Southern Marches, debauchée and despot,
whose very winepresses ran blood. Christopher,
Canon of Agravale, the episcopal secretary, was
pointing his quill on the Bishop’s left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, leaning against a stone pillar by the
door, stared hard at the man seated in dead
Ronan’s chair. The Lord Bishop of Agravale
was a comely cleric, black of chin and bright of
eye. A broad beak of a nose overhung a pair of
full red lips. There was a sensual and feline
smirk upon the face, an opulent and unctuous
pride that shone from curved nostril and twitching
mouth. His face was the face of a man who lived
rather for his loins than for his soul. An affected
dignity served to impress the mob with the ascetic
sanctity of the episcopal honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Jocelyn and Benedict of the Marches
sat cheek by jowl, debating together over a state
letter to the Pope. At intervals the Bishop cast
a rapid sentence into the ear of the Canon at his
elbow, a pearl of sapience that the discreet cleric
hoarded on the parchment under his hand. A
silver bell tinkled from the Bishop’s table. Silence
descended on those assembled. The throng of
armed men parted, giving way before two guards
who brought forward a man with his hands bound
behind his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan knew the fellow for a smith and
armourer in the town, a rugged, cross-grained
ranter, a stout follower of Samson in the path of
heresy. The man had a bloody cloth bound about
his head and his yellow beard bristled under his
sullen face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Jocelyn, lolling in his chair, considered
the prisoner at his leisure, under drooping lids.
He tilted his carnivorous nose with the air of a
vulture, sniffed, and spoke with a high-pitched
and priestly drawl, throating forth his words as
though they came from his Mass Book. Tristan
mistrusted the voice as a watch-dog mistrusts the
persuasive cajolings of a thief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend,” said the Bishop, moistening his lips,
“God prevent you from being damned to eternal
torment. The Mother Church is merciful even to
those who rebel against her care. Tell us, good
son, why the people of Joyous Vale have rebelled
against our Father the Pope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man before the daïs was no panderer to
the power of prosperity. He was as stubborn
rock, quarried out of the very mountains that
circled Joyous Vale. Moreover, he was sustained
by pride in the primitive faith for which he was
ready to stake all the tangible benefits of existence.
From sheer native obstinacy of soul he was
ordained a martyr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Priest,” he said, with blunt disrespect, “put
off your gold chain and the rings from your fingers.
Wash the hypocrisy from your face. Then I will
speak with you as man to man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The churchman flushed a little under his smooth
skin, pursed up his mouth, made a sign of the
cross before him in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” he said, with superb pity, “we are
not here for obscenity and abuse, but for the
controverting and purging of error. God pardon
me if I am as iron with a froward flock. I will put
such questions to you as will prove your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prove what you will,” said the smith with a
frown; “you would damn the Christ, were He set
here in my place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain of the rough men about the walls
laughed at the retort. They loved courage and
an insolent spirit even though their swords were
to quench the same. The Bishop heightened his
beneficent pity, towering from his pedestal of piety
with the superb and unconscious egotism of the
cleric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” he said, “will you obey our Father
the Pope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I obey no Pope,” came the echo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you revere the Sacraments?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I claim the wine for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blasphemy, my son. Should the Holy Blood
touch your tainted lips? I trow not. As for confession
and the remittance of sins——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God defend us from such lying ordinances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None can remit sins save God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Jocelyn smiled like a Stephen, lifted up
his face to the reeking roof, laid his hand on the
silver bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hence,” he said, “we must purge this acre.
God have pity on these fools; they know not what
they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strong hands swept the man away; he disappeared
into the press like a fallen tree dragged
down by the eddies of a stream in flood. A knot
of armed men charged out by the door, bearing
an honest martyr in their midst. The floor before
the Bishop’s chair was empty. A hush fell upon
the hall. Tristan, keen as a hawk, waited for
what should follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An odour of violets breathed sudden upon his
face. The perfume recalled to him a woman’s
room, burdened with odours, smothered with
colours and fair flowers. The scent seemed to fall
as from the richly embroidered bosom of a woman’s
gown. Turning, he saw, with a leap of the heart,
Rosamunde standing under the arch of the doorway,
the woman Isabel shivering at her heels.
The men gave back from her as from before a
queen. The Lady of La Vallée Joyeuse carried her
pride like an ivory coronet upon her brow. Tristan
saw no fear upon her face, no tremor upon her
lips. She moved towards the daïs, her green gown
sweeping the stones, her long hair streaking her
shoulders. She looked neither to the right hand
nor the left. Her eyes were fixed upon the red
banner blazoned with a yellow cross that hung
above dead Ronan’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great silence held the hall. The rough men
of the sword stared mutely at the woman’s face,
as she stood, a living emblem of tragedy, pale yet
unfrightened, strong in her own strength. A
slight colour played upon her face as she sustained
the insolent gapings of those around her. Man
muttered to man. Some jeered and grinned,
elbowed each other, croaked like birds of prey.
As for Tristan, the hot blood rose to his brain;
he set his teeth, took a deep breath, bided his time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Jocelyn was staring Rosamunde over
with an appreciative loosening of the mouth that
was in no way platonic. His eyes had a glassy
brilliance under the finely arched brows. He
played with the silver clapper of the bell, rose to
his feet with an exaggerated display of courtesy,
spoke to Rosamunde as she stood before the daïs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, letting his glances rove
over her full bosom and splendid throat, “we of
the Church hold you accused of treachery and
treason to our Holy Father the Pope. You and
your people have set his ordinances at defiance.
For this reason were we bidden to gather the
armed sons of the Church, and make war upon
such heretics as blasphemed the Creed. Yet,
madame, it is given us to promise mercy to those
whose hearts remain not froward towards the
truth. God has dealt hardly with you and your
home to-night. There is yet time for Mother
Church to receive you once more into her bosom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, rugged rebel, would have laughed at
the priest’s words had the chance been less
momentous. God’s justice, forsooth! Mercy
from the intolerable tyranny of the Church! The
stout sense in him jeered and mocked at the
pharisaical verbiage. Straining from the pillar,
peering over the shoulder of the man in front of
him, he waited with a frown for Rosamunde’s
answer. He was forewarned in his heart what her
words would be. Her back was towards him, yet
there shone clear defiance from every line of her
tall frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Priest,” she said at last, casting out her words
so that they seemed to smite the wall, “do you
blaspheme God by working iniquities in His
name? Is it Christ’s ordinance to spill blood—to
dishonour women? Out upon you, mummers and
jugglers that you are! Burn me to-night if the
deed suits your religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words rang like the blows of a sword in
Tristan’s brain. Heavens! she had courage! The
man exulted even in the temerity of her scorn.
He mouthed her words over to himself with a grim
and strenuous relish. Here were home-thrusts for
the gamblers with God. Bishop Jocelyn still stood
behind the table, a sleek worldliness warming his
shaven face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said slowly, “your tongue out-runs
your reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your charity perhaps,” she answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn spoke on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been unstrung by the terrors of
the night,” he said. “Calm yourself, return to
your room, wait for the day. Commune with
faith; pray, pray that the Holy Virgin may cleanse
the heresy from your heart. On the morrow,
madame, you shall speak with me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bishop,” she said, with face upturned, “words
will not serve you to change my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the future prove,” he answered, “your
blood runs hot to-night. Let me counsel you to
ponder your peril in solitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have considered all,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to the poverty of your faith,” he
retorted; “on the morrow, madame, we will sift
your doubts together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rang the bell, while his eyes remained fixed
on Rosamunde’s face. The guards came forward
to take her from the hall. Setting herself between
them without a word, she turned and walked
steady and erect towards the door. The tongues
of those assembled seemed loosed on the instant.
A babel of laughter echoed under the roof amid
the swirling smoke of the flambeaux; a wave of
colour swept along the painted shields. Above
the uproar came the insistent tinkling of the
Bishop’s bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the doorway, Rosamunde came to a
sudden halt, like one smitten on the face. She had
seen Tristan standing by the wall, and their eyes
had met, flashed, held in one swift stare. Scorn
was on the woman’s lips, a sudden pallor upon
her forehead. Tristan read “traitor” in that glance
of hers. The white cross seemed to burn his
bosom, for even as he stood speechless she passed
out and was gone.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, strong man that he was, blundered out
from the hall much as Peter fled from before the
face of Christ. The thrust was perhaps the more
bitter seeing that he was innocent, nay, brimming
with ardent faith. The night breeze played upon
his face as he reached the terrace; the stars were
bright in the heavens, the moon streaming up
through mountainous clouds. Pools of gloom lay
between the fields of silvery vapour. Houses were
burning in the town below, a red haze of smoke
and light pouring from the place as from a pit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, stung with shame, hurried out
through the bloodstained court to the gardens
fathoms deep in gloom. A sudden frost seemed
to have fallen upon his heart, though his face
still burnt with the blaze of Rosamunde’s scorn.
The last look from her eyes seemed colder to him
than the glances of the stars. Great passionate
boy that he was, the wrong stung him like the
hatred of a lost friend. Had not Rosamunde
kissed him on the forehead that very day? He
threw himself down on a grass bank and wept,
and the damp grass licked his face as he rolled
restlessly from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newly inspired chivalry sank before the
spear of rebellious pride. As for Rosamunde, had
he not served her well? Martyrs and saints! was
he deserving of such infidelity at her hands? The
woman was a fool, had no wit in her to read the
true cunning of a man’s endeavours. She was
fickle as moonlight, quick to mistrust at the first
mutterings of doubt. Moreover, he had wept over
the injustice, he, Tristan the iron-faced, who had
never puled since he left the cradle. Ha! if this
was gratitude and faith, he would think no more
of Joyous Vale, and this proud-lipped dame who
conceived all men to have been born her lackeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full of such callow spite as this, Tristan
floundered up, tightened his sword belt, brushed
the moisture from his face, passed on towards the
town. Soldiers were returning from the castle,
cursing and shouting under the trees. Rough
horseplay ruled the road. Men were riding on
each other’s shoulders, singing, scuffling, quarrelling
as they went. Tristan, shy of such company
for the moment, kept to the dark and the paths
through the thickets. He strode on morosely,
eating his own heart, letting his temper rage with
the uncontrolled sincerity of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the town by a narrow by-lane, he
bore for the market-place, where the waves of riot
ran high. The Papal troops were as wild beasts let
loose in an arena, and mere human flesh seemed
an insignificant sacrifice for their savage zeal. Men
were even hewing down the houses with axe and
hammer, as though to leave no stone or beam
unbroken in the place. Children were tossed
from the attic windows on the bristling spears
beneath. The wild pirates from the old pagan
north had never worked more savagely than these
children of the Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s anger began to cool apace before he
had gone far through the streets of the town.
No such tortures had been known in Purple Isle
as were perpetrated here under the benediction of
the Church. Men put indiscriminately to the
sword, women dishonoured, children thrown from
the flaming houses. The streets were full of death
and despair; the very town was a great slaughter-house.
Horror descended like a cloud on Tristan’s
brain. He was weak as a frightened child for the
moment amid the devastation of the night. The
anger oozed from him like wine from a cracked
jar. Only a great and empty pity remained in its
stead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming to the market square, he stood as one
dazed by the terrific action of a dream. The place
was packed with drunken men, wearing indeed the
livery of the Church, yet appearing with their
flaming torches more as the acolytes of hell. Great
stakes had been set in the midst of the square,
faggots and the timbering of ravaged houses
piled around. Even as Tristan watched from
under the low eaves of a house, a knot of soldiers
passed him, bearing on their shoulders the figure
of a man. He was so swathed in cordage as to
look like an encased mummy. Setting the victim
against a stake, they chained him there, buffeting
and spitting in his face, as he had been the Christ.
Torches licked at the faggots, and deep ululations
ran through the square with the strident psalming
of the monks for an underchant. The flames
writhed like golden snakes; smoke blackened out
the faces of the stars. Tristan saw the figure
chained to the post jerk and strain from the rising
flames. The man’s hands came free. He clutched
the beam above his head, strove with great throes
of agony to climb above the fire. Soon the smoke
throttled him; the flames played the part of a
shroud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, sick with the sight, turned back down
the street with his brain a-swimming. Would they
set Dame Rosamunde in the market square and
burn her there as they had burnt the smith? A
great faintness gathered round; the reek of charred
wood was in his nostrils. The flare of the flames
died over the houses and the din and clamour
grew less and less. Stumbling on, he reached the
outskirts of the town, where the meadows ran
white under the moon. The clean breath of the
night beat on his face, and the scent of the pine
woods rolled down from the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A limb of the lake gleamed in the meadows.
Tristan went down to the water’s brim, knelt in
the weeds, and drank from his palms. He dashed
up water in his face, let it run down his chest,
cold and clean, rose up again with his heart more
steady. The town still flickered and yelped under
the stars. He turned his back on it and made
towards the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scenes in Ronan’s town still played on his
thoughts. Had he been zealous in the pay of the
Church, his faith would have quailed before the
deeds done that night. Moloch could have hungered
for no bloodier work than this. Tristan
remembered Ronan’s town as he had first seen
it from the hills, glimmering peacefully in silver
and green. He remembered the children playing
in its streets, the red, comely women drawing water
at its wells, the sturdy peasants labouring in the
fields. If such a brutal doom as this had fallen
upon Purple Isle? His sire slain, his mother—God
forbid the thought. He grew grim and
savage as his courage kindled; the petulant weakness
of an hour had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Rosamunde, her proud face was above
him once again, clear as the moon, overtopping
his manhood. The passionate spite had melted
away, for he comprehended now the scorn in her
heart. She was wiser, older, less selfish than he.
Rosamunde had forecasted the savage zeal that
had scorched the valley and those whom she loved,
while his imagined falseness had embittered the
truth. Tristan cursed his own hot wrath. What
was he that he should resent her doubts! How
else could she have read the cross on his breast?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woods descended upon the meadows and
the hills seemed to stretch their great arms to him
out of the night. Tristan, full of a simple
devotion, a sudden strong passion of chivalrous
pity, knelt down under a tree and tore the white
cross from his breast. The moonlight played
upon his face as he knelt with arms folded, and
made his short prayer openly in the eyes of
Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great God and Father,” ran the words, “Thou
who avengest all things, strengthen Thou my
heart. Let honour prevail against those who
blaspheme Thy mercy. Thou who didst gird King
David against the pagans, give to Thy servant a
strong arm and an unblunted sword. Here—now—I
pledge my faith to these two women, even to
Rosamunde and to Columbe my sister. Holy
Jesu, shine Thou upon my shield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as Tristan prayed the stars seemed to
brighten in the heavens, as at the touch of some
high seraph’s hand. The man knelt a long while
in the grass, thinking of Rosamunde, how she
believed him a traitor. His heart was strengthened
against her fate. He swore that night that he
would prove his faith to her, even though it
brought him to the gate of death.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, standing at her window high in the
tower of Joyous Vale, watched the dawn cleanse
the sombre east. Over the hills the golden
chariots flew. In the valleys, the shadows, like
giant snakes, writhed and darted from the rush
of the dawn. The heavens had taken the colour
of June. Gold, azure, and rose were woven
together as by the might of invisible hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, with dark shadows under her eyes,
watched the burnt town rise out of the gloom.
No glimmering casements flashed up to the dawn,
no spirelets glittered, no red roofs shone. Smoke
veiled the air beyond the gardens and the sleek
green meadows, where tottering walls shook like
palsied patriarchs, shaking their heads over this
deed of shame. Charred beams stood black beneath
the sky. The reeking ruin of the place rose
up to Rosamunde from the dewy love-lap of the
dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the lake the great ships lay at anchor, their
white wings folded, standards and streamers afloat
from their masts. Their prows were blazoned with
many shields. The water, a silver sheet, lay
spread about them, calm and clear. In the
meadows the host had pitched camp for the night,
and there were many pavilions ranged over the
grass, red and purple, white and blue. A grove
of spears stood round Benedict’s tent, with many
shields swinging to the breeze. Horses were
picketed on the outskirts of the woods. A company
of men-at-arms stood to their lances without the
great gate of the castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, leaning on the sill, put back her
hair from off her forehead, and met the truth with
a bitter calm. The burnt town betrayed the terrors
of the night. A great silence covered the ruins;
only the meadows spoke of life. From the tower
she could look into the market square, where
the charred posts still stood amid the steaming
ashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her loneliness grew the more apparent as Rosamunde
looked out over the lake and the hills rising
purple against the blue. Yesterday, necessity had
stirred her courage and peopled a province with
her cares. Her quick sympathies had created
comrades. To-day all was changed. Death had
claimed the allegiance of her people. Outlanders
held her home, fed within her hall, lounged and
jested in her courts. They had even taken the
woman Isabel from her for the night, for the
Bishop had ordained that she should be left alone
with her own soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stood at the window, she thought of
Tristan, traitor, as she believed. If she had ever
trusted a man, she had trusted him, with his blunt
tongue and his ugly face. None the less, his eyes
must have lied to her again and again. Truly,
he had played his part with a cunning mask of
ingenuous passion. He had let the Pope’s men
in. Spy and hireling that he was, he had blinded
her well as to what should follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hated Tristan with an immoderate hate as
she stood at her window that golden day in June,
for the burnt town seemed to stand as a grim
witness to his dishonour. Why had he saved
Samson from the sword? That he might blind
her the more with professions of faith. She had
trusted her heart in his great hands, and he had
stood to mock her before them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bar was withdrawn suddenly from her
door, and the woman Isabel thrust into the room
by those without. There was a clanging to and
fro of harness in the galleries. Isabel had orders
to prepare her lady for a second meeting with the
Bishop. Rosamunde suffered the woman’s prattle
with the listless silence of one whose thoughts flow
deep. The army was to march southwards along
the lake, so ran the report. Holy Chrysostom!
the night had been red with blood! Would
madame wear her grey gown with the blue sleeves?
Yes. ’Twas very comely. And the girdle of
beaten steel, with the poniard fastened thereto?
Ah, yes, they had searched the place, and taken
away the knife. Bishop Jocelyn was a courtly
prelate, so men said. One of his servants was
bringing up wine and meat on a silver tray.
What? Madame had no taste for food? One
must live, though men made war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde broke in upon her patter, desirous
of hearing other news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have they taken Samson?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank the Lord, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of Tristan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I have not seen the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde kept her countenance under the
woman’s stare, and though her face felt hot she
did not colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fellow had a hot heart and too ready a
hand. He is slain, perhaps. God rest his soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde told nothing of the imagined truth,
and of the beginning of her hate. Isabel had not
seen Tristan in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anon, robed, and fed by the Bishop’s clemency,
she was taken by Christopher the Canon past the
iron-coated sentry at the door. As a prisoner she
passed through her own home, where the galleries
were empty, the chambers void. The Bishop’s
men had looted the place; they were carrying the
plunder to the ships. The champion of the Church
was worthy of his hire; many a cherished relic
saluted Rosamunde’s eyes no more. The hall
itself seemed grey and empty despite the streaming
sunlight through the narrow windows set high
up in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Jocelyn awaited her, sleek, polished,
buxom of face, a most creditable sympathy pervading
his mood. The heretic pleased, if the
heresy offended. He bade Canon Christopher set
Rosamunde a stool, thrust a silver mug aside
with his hand, spread his tablets, crossed himself,
and began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, “I have given you
audience alone, that we may talk the better. Mark
you—how the sun shines, and that June is with
us. The blood of the earth runs brisk and warm.
It is my purpose here to persuade you to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a suggestive comfort on the complacent
face. The man’s philosophy smacked of
compromise. That he was not unloth to pardon
her, Rosamunde could see full well, yet she mistrusted
his voice, strident with sanctimony, his
soft, mobile mouth, his glittering eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether it is better to lie than to die,” she
answered him, “out of the abundance of your
righteousness, you can tell me, Lord Bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daughter,” he said, mouthing his words with
an air of relish, “surely it is better to procrastinate
for a month, than to be damned instantly and for
ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your charity foredooms me—thus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, St. Peter has the keys of heaven,
and we are St. Peter’s ministers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The retort was such a one as Samson the
Heretic would have rent with the splendid sincerity
of his scorn. To Rosamunde, numb and lonely
as she was, there yet appeared a grim pharisaical
humour in the perfumed piety of this complacent
prelate, decreeing the eternal fate of God-given
souls. Could this lapwing, this piping swan, so
far deceive himself and others as to claim the
power of final pardon or of endless punishment?
Rosamunde awoke at the thought with an echo of
Samson’s strenuous eloquence in her memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Priest,” she said very calmly, “we of La Vallée
Joyeuse have been taught that a man’s soul speaks
face to face with the Living God. Here we have
hired no spiritual chapmen to trade and barter
with our prayers. I claim my daughtership before
Christ our Lord. Sure am I, that even as Mary
of Bethany sat before God’s face, so may I serve
Him without bribing the hirelings of a degenerate
Church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bishop Jocelyn set his finger tips together,
elevated his eyebrows, suffered a slight smile to
play upon his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said to her, “it is easy for me
to know that you have been deceived by plausible
and disastrous doctrines. It is easy to impose on
women, seeing that they catch the reflection of
any bold man’s mind. They answer men, as tides
the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are in error,” she retorted. “My
conscience stands upon the mountain-top, and
shuns not the light. I believe what I believe. I
know my own heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he said, with something of a sigh, “you
are obdurate, my daughter, obdurate to the point
of death. I fear there is but little hope for you.
Well, well, I have played my part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rang his silver hand bell, and a captain in
full chain harness came in through a side door
with a company of archers at his back. The men
stood to their arms. Such were the justiciaries
employed by the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” said Jocelyn with vigour, changing
instantly his persuasive pose, “recant your
heresy, or the stake awaits you. Come. Are you
prepared to burn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him mutely, doubtingly, pale to
the lips. The heavy breathing of the guards
fanned the stagnant air. Above her hung the
churchman’s face, contending passions playing
thereon, like a red sunset through a cloud. The
loneliness and despair cried out in her; the flesh
rose up against the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this your mercy?” she asked him, breathing
fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I am sent to prevent blasphemy, to
restore the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! can you convert us by burning our
bodies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you burn not now, woman, you will burn
in hell hereafter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood back two steps from him, staring at
the floor. In imagination, she heard the hiss of
the green faggots, the grim purr of the gathering
flames, felt their scorching breath upon her face.
Was there no salvation save in this stark death?
Was a heart full of convictions worth such torture?
Great helplessness fell like a fog about her
brain. Life, ruddy and eager, cried out for pity;
the lust to live grew quick and violent in her blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tempt me to the death,” she said, with
head thrown back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, my sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, to life. Lift up your face to the
Church’s bosom. It is warm and fragrant to the
faithful. Come, sister, come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swayed forward like one about to faint,
clutched at the table, steadied herself upon her
straining arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I surrender,” she said hoarsely. “What else
is there for me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man leant forward, touched her forehead,
marked with his finger an invisible cross thereon.
He smiled and laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust in the Church, my sister,” he said; “it
is enough. By God’s grace we shall cure you of
the canker of heresy.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop’s men had plucked up their tents from
about the blackened ruins of Ronan’s town, and
marched southwards from La Vallée Joyeuse,
burning and plundering as they went. They found
few to poise the spear and trim the shield against
them in those green wilds. The folk of the Seven
Streams were scattered amid their moors and
forests, nor had they banded together any great
company of men-at-arms. Sometimes a lonely
tower stood forth upon the hills, to start into scarlet
flower when menaced by the Holy Truncheon of
the Church. The peasant folk had fled to the
mountains and the deep gloom of the woods, for
these crusaders marched to purge the land, and
torch and sword claimed an eloquent apostleship
in that rough age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The southern fleet had set its sails, and sailed
out by the river towards the sea. The waters of
Joyous Vale were left to the grebe and the heron,
to the wild duck’s cry and the dull note of the
bittern. Ronan’s tower stood a haunt for owls to
perch in; bats played under the rafters in the twilight;
spiders webbed the walls. Soon there would
be grass and shaggy weeds in court and terrace.
Briers would ravish the shrubs in the garden,
docks and nettles destroy the flowers. The vines
would fall from their rotting poles, the olives ripen
and receive no care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, Dame of Joyous Vale, had been
set within a horse litter, a litter with painted panels
and a canopy of purple cloth. The litter was
Bishop Jocelyn’s, but he had surrendered it to her
service, and mounted his white mule instead. A
guard of twenty men marched about Rosamunde
on the road, ten on foot and ten on horse. They
were bearing her southwards towards the mountainous
marches, over hills and through valleys
foreign to her ken. All day she heard the trumpets
whimper, saw pennons float and flicker through
the woods. At night she would mark a glare in
the dark sky, the glare of watchfires, or the flaming
crown of a martyred town. At times they would
let her walk beside the litter. No one spoke with
her save Bishop Jocelyn, for her woman Isabel
had turned wanton, and trudged the road with the
servants of Christopher, Canon of Agravale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Jocelyn, proud patron of the Faith, his
theology had taken the wings of Mercury, and
flown fast for temporal favours. He appeared
zealous to convince Dame Rosamunde of the infallible
nature of his doctrine. For the time being,
there was no hinting at faggots and the ordeal of
fire. He rode often beside the litter on his white
mule, casting his subtleties at the woman lying
within. He called her daughter, sister, child, as
the unction stirred in him, while sanctity bubbled
on his lips like wine out of a leaking cask. It
had a more classic odour than Heaven might have
desired. Since Bishop Jocelyn could conjure with
Peter’s keys, he did not hesitate to tamper with
the lock of honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Tristan le Sauvage, the burning of
Ronan’s town had set him full face before his own
strong manhood. The mere boisterous days of
youth were behind him as a sunny sea, for he
had seen death and had met distrust. Sterner,
bolder blood played through the red cavities of his
heart. To rebel against arrogance and tyranny
was to live. To shatter injustice, to overthrow
hypocrites, in such effort lay a strong man’s paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hidden in a thicket, he had seen Rosamunde
set forth from Ronan’s tower in Bishop Jocelyn’s
litter, the churchman riding beside her on his
white mule. They had not burnt the woman yet,
the fairest heretic in the land of the Seven Streams.
Whether she had recanted or no, he could not
tell, but Tristan, remembering the Bishop’s face,
prophesied no such fate for her from so sensuous
a source.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had found food the first morning in a
deserted cottage, yet his great need was a horse,
for the beast he had taken in the valley by the
sea had been converted once again to the service
of the Church. Following the Papists through the
woods on foot, he bided his time till night should
fall. The Bishop’s men camped under the shadow
of a hill, and Tristan, crawling down in the dark
through the grass, found the place where the
horses were tethered. His temerity prospered as
it deserved. He escaped untouched from the
Bishop’s ground, with a horse and food to reward
the venture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day he followed the army through the
wild, waiting his chance for a swoop from the
woods. What though twenty men marched round
Rosamunde’s litter? With her eyes to watch him,
he would break the steel wall, pluck the white rose
out of the midst. That would be man’s work,
worthy of a sword. He would set her behind him
on the saddle, ride for the woods, escape. What
then? First he would say to her with a noble
air, “Madame, declare, am I a traitor or no?”
Perhaps she would kiss him, even as she had
kissed him in Ronan’s tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chance came to Tristan one still evening
when the mists were rising in the valleys and the
sky was veiled with gold. The mounted men of
Rosamunde’s guard had lagged behind to water
their horses at a spring. They had loitered there,
jesting and swearing as a stone bottle passed from
hand to hand. Benedict’s men-at-arms were a
good five furlongs to the south, while the rear
guard marched by a track that ran westwards on
the far flank of a low hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan closed in, keeping cover behind the
trees. The horses bearing the litter were plodding
slowly, with heads hanging, ears adroop. The
purple curtains were open towards the east, and
Tristan could catch the white glimmer of a face
within. All around them were tall hills deluged
with green woods. A stream glittered through the
flats under elms and drooping willows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, with nostrils wide and every sinew taut
as steel, trotted on through a grove of birches
whose filmy foliage arabesqued the heavens. A
glade opened to the road below, the purple litter
shining like an amethyst set in green grass. The
guards were slouching in twos and threes about
the horses, their pikes and axes at the trail. Even
as Tristan watched, a white hand drew the curtain,
a mimic night drowning the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, twisting tight the strapping of his
shield, whipped out his sword, pushed his horse
to a gathering gallop down the glade. He shot
like a hurled spear out of the gloom. Hurtling
fast from the trees, he was on the men before they
knew him for a foe. “Holy Cross, Holy Cross!”
was his cry, as they scattered from him like pence
from an almoner’s palm. Swerving right and left,
his sword played grimly on their pates. Pike,
staff, helmet, buckler, he hewed through all, as a
woodman lops hazels with his bill. Five out of the
half score were down in the dust; the rest scurried
like winged partridges over the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was out of the saddle and beside the litter,
bridle in hand. Rosamunde had jerked the curtains
open at the first sound of the scuffle. It was
no moment for vapourings. Tristan, hot with his
sword work, played the master for once with a
rough chivalry that suited his fibre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, madame, out with you. I keep faith
to you, though you doubted me in Ronan’s hall.
Fast! We must make for the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan!” was all she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seized her suddenly in his eagerness, set
her upon the horse, climbed up before her. Her
arms girdled his body. She was silent and half
ashamed, as though shaken out of the injustice of
her hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The casket?” she asked him, as they made
towards the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lies fathoms deep in the lake,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan, you have served me well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have served you better, madame,”
he said simply, “if I had been in Ronan’s tower
before the Bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mouthed a sudden “hist” into his ear, her
arms tightening so that he could feel the rising
and falling of her bosom. The warm perfume of
her breath rose about his face. Half a score of
mounted men had rounded the angle of the road.
They sighted Tristan and Rosamunde on the rim
of the wood, saw the deserted litter, the dead men
in the road. They were at full gallop instanter
over the grass, swords agleam, lances pricking
the blue, while the hot babel of their tongueing
echoed through the valley. Tristan, with a grim
twist of the mouth, heeled on his horse and took
to the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great trees overarched the pair, and beams
of gold came slanting through. The grass was a
deep green under the purple shadows. Through
the silence came the dull thunder of hoofs, as the
men racketed on, swerving and blundering through
the trees. They rode faster than Tristan with
his delectable burden, and the distance dwindled
betwixt the pack and the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde was looking back over her shoulder,
her hair shimmering and leaping with the breeze.
The black boughs hurried over her head; the
trunks seemed to gallop in the gloom. She could
see steel flashing through the wood, like meteorites
plunging through a cloud. Her fear was for
Tristan as they threaded on, and she tightened
her arms round him, spoke in his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, with her chin on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hardly so much as turned his head, for his
eyes were piercing the shadows before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, set me down,” she said. “They will
take us both; better one than two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold fast, or you will fall,” was all he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me, Tristan,” she said again. “You
can outpace them alone; I am their prize. They
are ten to one; what can you do against ten
men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see,” he said through his set
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She surrendered for the moment, and clung to
his shoulders. An open glade broadened sudden
towards the east, a great star shining splendid
in the eastern sky. Rosamunde, clinging fast to
Tristan as they swayed along, heard a great
trampling of hoofs in the wood. The nearest galloper
swung out from the gloom. He was leaning
over the neck of his horse, his lips parted over
his teeth, his sword poised from his outstretched
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan glanced at him as they rode cheek by
jowl, their horses plunging down the glade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold off!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt, or I strike the woman first!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be damned for a dastard, if you dare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sword circled above Rosamunde’s head,
its whistling breath fanning her hair. She cowered
a little and loosened her hold. Tristan swerved
of a sudden, drew up his horse on sluthering hoofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off—off!” he roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde broke away and left him free. He
charged on, caught the man cross-counter as he
reined round to front him. The knight toppled
down beneath the great swoop of the sword.
Tristan clutched at the swinging bridle, gestured
to Rosamunde with his shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mount, mount! By God! we will fool them
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wood grew alive with shouting and the
noise of hoofs. Rosamunde’s guards had heard
the clangour of Tristan’s blow as he smote the first
man from the saddle. A second rider plunged
from the trees, where Tristan met him, horse to
horse. Their swords whimpered, screamed, and
clashed. Tristan’s blade struck the man’s throat
through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde had not mounted her horse, for the
brute had grown restive and broken away. She
stood by a tree and watched the fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard, Tristan, guard——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught a third sword on his upreared shield,
smote out from under it, maimed his man. Two
more blundered out of the gloom, while Rosamunde’s
voice rang out under the trees:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard, Tristan, guard! They are at your
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry came too late to the struggling knot
of steel, for two more riders had come from the
wood. One set his lance for the thrust, and smote
Tristan between the shoulders. The man gave a
roar like a wounded leopard, fought on awhile,
meeting their swords like a sea-girt rock. A
second lance-thrust pierced his side. His horse,
overweighted, stumbled and rolled down. Tristan
fell free, but did not move. The men trampled
him underfoot, and turned on Rosamunde, who
stood by a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an hour she was lying in the litter again,
with the faint moon peering in through the hangings.
Her eyes were dusky as the heavens above,
her face pale, her lips adroop. She was thinking
of Tristan slain in the woods, for he had proved
his faith to her even in death.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Under the shade of a beech tree on the slope of a
hill a man sat with a bare sword laid across his
knees. On the hill-top above, half-hidden by
pines, the walls of a ruined house rose against the
unclouded sky. A deep valley dwindled beneath,
choked with woodland and cleft in twain by a white
band where a torrent thundered. Far to the south
mountains towered against the gold of the evening
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Tristan le Sauvage who sat with his
sword laid across his knees, watching the valley
and the darkening hillside. Near by, an iron pot
steamed over a wood fire, the smoke thereof ascending
straight into the heavens. By the gate of the
ruin a cistus was in bloom, its petals falling upon
the long grass and the broken stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had been busy burnishing his sword,
handling it lovingly, even as a miser fingers gold.
Shield, helmet, and hauberk lay in the grass at his
feet. His face was less boyish than of old, though
but a month had passed since he had been left
stricken and bleeding in the woods. He had been
near death, and the staunch struggle to escape the
grave had set a maturer forethought on his face.
Moreover, he had suffered in heart as well as body,
and the brisk youth in him moved to a sadder
tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he sat there under the shadow of the beech
tree, burnishing his sword and parleying with the
thoughts within his heart, a horn called to him
from out the woods. The shrill echoes clamoured
amid the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, Tristan,” they seemed to cry, like
ghost voices stealing out of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man rose up from under the shade of the
tree, and looked out down the hillside under his
hand. Betimes, a figure mounted on a shaggy
horse drew from the woods, and climbed the slope
towards the ruin. The man was clad in chain mail
that rippled in the sunlight, and he carried neither
shield nor spear. At his back he bore a stout
yew bow, and the body of a deer was slung before
him on the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan went out from under the tree, his
bronzed face beaming in the sun. It was Samson
the Heretic, returned from hunting in the woods,
Samson, who had taken Tristan for dead where
the Bishop’s men had left him, and recalled him
to life amid the grey walls of the old ruin. The
Heretic had followed Rosamunde from Joyous
Vale, and lurked in the woods to cheat the Papists
of their prey. Skulking with a few followers in
the thickets, he had seen Tristan swoop from out
the woods and seize on Rosamunde from the litter.
Thus it had fallen out that Samson had found
Tristan bleeding under the trees where he had been
outmatched by Jocelyn’s men. Samson had taken
him upon his horse, abandoning Rosamunde for
Tristan’s sake, and in this old sanctuary had
wrought his cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men met with that heartiness of hand and
voice that bespeaks brotherhood, that linking up
of faith with straight looks and fearless words.
Tristan, still smiling, took the body of the deer
from the Heretic’s saddle bow. The shaft had
flown straight to the poor beast’s heart. Tristan
marked it, as he slung the deer to a bough
of the beech tree, building analogies in his
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were this Jocelyn,” he said, “I should envy
you, brother, to the point of death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That murderous hand of yours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, Samson, shall I not pluck out the heart of
that man, even as he plucked the Lady Rosamunde
out of Ronan’s tower? What is youth but battle?
and I am young, methinks, young enough to fly
for the Southern Marches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson was unsaddling his horse. He
stayed with his fingers on the buckle, and half
stooping, looked somewhat sadly into Tristan’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware,” he said, “lest you open the old
wounds again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan spread his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have bled,” he said, “and shall bleed again,
methinks, or be called coward by every pledge of
my good youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson lifted the saddle to the grass, and
stood up, fingering his beard and looking Tristan
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men murmur for the sword,” he said. “I
met Malan in the woods to-day, after I had slain
this beast with a long flight. They clamour to be
led against those who have harried and sacked the
Seven Streams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them murmur; I echo them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are tough as leather. Shall we not take the
sword?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is God’s will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never had men better cause than we.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Heretic had not been idle while he played
the Samaritan to Tristan in the ruin amid the
woods. Even as in the wake of a great ship the
waters seethe and foam, so the rude peasant folk
of the Seven Streams had risen in the track of the
Bishop’s host. Burnt hamlets and ruined towers,
these were their witnesses, their solemn oracles.
They had flocked to Samson, these homeless men
whose kinsfolk had fallen to Jocelyn’s swords.
Samson had preached to them more fiercely than
of old. They were as tinder to a torch, these
woodlanders; they were ready to burn for him in
the quitting of revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Tristan and the Heretic watched
the sun go down behind the hills, and spoke
together of what might chance to them in the
unknown. Far to the south towered the great
mountains, like sable pyramids fringed with fire.
The stream clamoured in the woods beneath, as
though it voiced the turbulence of the age. They
spoke together, these two men, of Rosamunde, of
Joyous Vale, and the Bishop’s war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, lifting his sword, pointed it to a star
that shone solitary in the southern sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us remember Ronan’s town,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a strange smile on Samson’s face as
he laid his hand on Tristan’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever life may give,” he said, “some joy,
much pain, travail, and discontent, I trow there is
no better quest in life than such a one as hangs
upon your sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak in riddles,” quoth the younger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This star, what a riddle lives therein.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your tongue plays with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, brother; have I not said enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men looked into each other’s eyes.
On Samson’s face there was that goodly light that
streams up from a generous heart, brave and bounteous,
man’s love for man. In the Heretic there
were no ignoble moods, and, like Paul of old, he
esteemed himself little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” he said, “the fight for the truth
gives its own guerdon. That you are with us, I
know full well; moreover, I mind me that a man’s
heart reaches through human love into heaven. A
fair face, two trustful eyes, the waving of a
woman’s hair. How many a pure spell is wrought
with these!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood leaning on his sword, looking not
at Samson, but towards the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you so old?” he asked him suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You followed also through the woods. And
had the eyes no spell for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson leant his arm over Tristan’s shoulders,
even like an elder brother, who banishes self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me,” he said, “are no such songs as men
make at sunset when the heavens are red.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Rosamunde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can one bound to God, even as I am bound,
turn to look on a woman’s face? Nay, Tristan,
my brother, the dream is thine, a dream to set thy
young blood stirring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan looked long into the Heretic’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You love her?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have loved her,” Samson made answer,
“even as others have loved her, because one cannot
look on her unmoved. It is her privilege to be
loved, yet may not my eyes confess the truth.
Yours is the hand that must seize the torch, yours
the sword that shall cleave the spell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Christ’s man, brother. What I do, I do
with my whole heart.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and the Heretic rode south-west towards
the sea with their hundred lances aslant under the
summer sky. They were as men challenging a
kingdom with their swords, and they tossed their
shields in the face of fate. The fine audacity of
such a venture set the hot blood spinning in their
hearts. To raise the banner of liberty aloft against
Pomp and Power! To hurl damnation in the
mouth of the Church!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Papists had left garrisons in many of the
strong places of the Seven Streams. The main
host had recrossed the river known in those parts
as the Lorient, and had camped about Agravale,
ducal city of the Southern Marches. They had
raided the province of the Seven Streams into a
desert, so far that life seemed absent. A great
silence had descended over the land. Hamlets
were in ashes; towers stood mere blackened shells
upon the hills. As to the lords and gentry of the
province, they had either fallen or taken like outlaws
to the woods. It was such desperate men as
these that Samson coveted to swell his company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pushed on warily, avoiding such places
as were garrisoned by the Bishop’s men. Samson
was as a merchant who possessed one ship; he
would not imperil her as yet in troublous waters.
Men gathered slowly to him as he made his march,
grim, stony-faced men whose silence seemed fiercer
than their words. Blood was thicker than dogmas
and decretals; they had one common bond, these
children of heresy, one common vengeance. They
had suffered, all of them, in home and heart. In
three days Samson’s company had increased to the
number of two hundred spears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Tristan, he was as a hound in leash; his
sword thirsted in its scabbard; he had tasted blood,
and was hot for a tussle. His sinews were taut
despite the southron’s spear, and his strength
seemed greater than of yore, perhaps because his
heart bulked bigger. Nightly when they camped
in the woods he would wrestle with any man whose
ribs could bear his hug. He could take Samson
by the hips, burly man that he was, and hold him
high above his head. The fellows would gather
round and gape at the giant. Tristan began to
know his power the more as he found strong men
mere pygmies in his grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They held westwards towards the sea, through
grassy plains where streams went winding ever
through the green, and poplars threw their towering
shadows on the sward. Samson had trudged
the land through in the days of his preaching. He
knew each hamlet, each road, each ford. The
Papists had padded through this same region like
a pack of wolves, and Tristan and the Heretic
found no life therein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth day they came upon the ruins of
a small town set upon a hill in a wooded valley.
Vultures flapped heavenwards as they rode into the
gate; lean, red-eyed curs snarled and slinked about
the streets. Tristan smote one brute through with
his spear that was feeding in the gutter on the carcass
of a child. In the market square the Papists
had made such another massacre as they had perpetrated
in Ronan’s town. The horrible obscenity
of the scene struck Samson’s men dumb as the
dead. The townsfolk had been stripped, bound
face to face, left slain in many a hideous and
ribald pose. The vultures’ beaks had emulated the
swords. The stench from the place was as the
breath of a charnel house, and Samson and his men
turned back with grim faces from the brutal silence
of that ghastly town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near one of the gates a wild, tattered figure
darted out from a half-wrecked house, stood blinking
at them in the sun, a filthy tangle of hair over
his dirty face. The creature gestured and gibbered
like any ape. He fled away when Samson approached,
screaming and whimpering as though
possessed with a devil. The man was mad, had
lost his reason in the slaughter of children and
kinsfolk. Save the dogs and the vultures, he was
the one live thing they found in the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were beyond the walls and under
the clean shadows of the trees, Samson lifted up
his hand to the heavens like one who called on God
for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, shall such deeds pass?” he said.
“Before God, I trow not. Heaven temper our
swords in the day of vengeance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s thoughts were beyond the mountains,
hovering about a golden head and the ruffian
priests who ruled the south. What might her fate
be at the hands of the Church? His manhood rose
in him like a sea thundering up in the throat of
a cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson,” he said, with iron mouth, “God be
thanked for the strength of my body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, thank God for it,” said the Heretic,
grimly enough. “Would I had the power of a
hundred men. My strength should be a hammer
to pulverise these dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, Heaven see to it, when I have Jocelyn
by the throat, I will break his back as I would
break a distaff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hard by the sea there was a certain strong place
set upon a rock, Tor’s Tower by name. It was a
wild pile of masonry clinging to naked stone, wind-beaten
and boisterous. The place had fallen by
treachery into Papist hands, so Samson gathered
from men who joined him on the march. A Papal
garrison had been established there, some of the
bloodiest ruffians in the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tor’s Tower stood a mile from a great arm of
the sea. Between the rock and the shore were
treacherous marshes, while on the landward side
wild heathland dipped to a waste of woods. Dull
skies hurried over the place; the wind piped keen
from over the sea. A narrow causeway led to the
tower, winding round the flank of the rock. It
was the very aerie Samson coveted till he had
hatched a flight of goodly eagles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rode through the woods and reconnoitred
the tower, saw that weeks would be needed
to starve such a place. Even as he lay hid in the
woods, some two-score spears rode home from a
foray, passing close by Tristan’s lair. They had
wine skins and spoil laid over their shoulders, also
two young peasant girls bound back to back, and
tied together on a horse. The men’s rough jesting
reached Tristan’s ears, he heard their oaths
and their unclean talk. His fingers itched for the
pommel of his sword; he kept cover, however, and
bided his time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Samson were soon agreed in the
matter. When dark had fallen, they marched over
the moor, left twenty men to guard the causeway,
climbed up with the rough ladders they had hewn
in the woods. The sky was of ebony, sealed up
against the stars. Half the Papists were drunk in
the place when Samson’s men planted their ladders
against the wall. Tristan was the first to leap down
into the court. He slew two guards who kept the
gate, hurled down the bar, shot back the bolts.
Samson’s men came in like a mill-race, and there
was bloody work in court and hall. When they
had made an end of the vermin, they cast their
bodies down the cliff, remembering Joyous Vale
and the town in the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Samson watched the dawn streak
the eastern sky with gold above the woods. They
were masters of Tor’s Tower and the wild wastes
that glimmered towards the sea, while fifty dead
men were wallowing in the marshes at the foot of
the rock. The tower was well victualled, could
be held for months by loyal and wary men.
Samson was for making it a rocky refuge to the
scattered companies of the Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me but one sure pinnacle,” he said,
striking the battlements with the scabbard of his
sword, “one high place where we may rear up our
flag, and the sheep will take courage, gather, turn
to a pack of wolves. Tor’s Tower shall be our
beacon height. Give me till the spring, and the
southrons shall find no feeble rabble for their
swords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had a more passionate quest within his
heart, and his thoughts, like swift swallows,
pinioned south. He had sworn solemnly to his
own honour that he would follow Rosamunde and
set her free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” he said, “hold Tor’s Tower till I
come again; send out your riders through the
countryside. Men will gather when a flag’s unfurled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go where you will,” said Samson, grasping
his shoulder; “the star leads towards the south.
Ha, good rogue, have I not hit you fair? God
keep you on such an errand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ride south,” said Tristan, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take ten men with you. I can spare no
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” said Tristan, “I am content with my
own carcass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What devil’s scheme has caught your heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan laughed, spread his great chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson,” he said, “believe me no traitor when
I go to take service in the Bishop’s guard. I shall
prove a good smiter, doubt it not. Master Jocelyn
shall not complain of my sword.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The ducal city of Agravale queened it in the
south amid the gloom of her ilex woods and the
perfumes of her pines. The city stood on the verge
of a great precipice that plunged to the sweeping
waters of the river Gloire. Southwards from this
line of precipices, crowned in the centre by the
towers of Agravale, stretched a broad valley
spreading many leagues to the great mountains
that closed the Marches from the nether south.
The plain was a vine-clad Arcady, rich in olives,
painted thick with flowers. Purple and green and
gold, it swept to the sombre bosoms of the mountains,
whose snowy peaks smote like moonlight
through the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the north a wilderness of woods covered the
plateau that ended in the great precipice above the
river. Black was the tincture of this wild, a gloomy
green like the sullen depths of some unsailed sea.
Here the ilex made midnight in the valleys, and
the stone pine lifted its beseeching palms towards
the sky. Holly and cedar, cypress, oak, and yew,
a torrential wilderness of trees choked up the valleys
and concealed the hills. Here the wolf hunted and
the wild boar rooted in the glades. Only the wind
made music, while the shadows danced and
quivered on the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agravale, proud city of the south, lay pale and
luxurious under the southern sky. Its white walls
stretched like marble veins into the sombre green-stone
of the woods. It was an opulent city, sleek,
sinful, and magnificent. Colour enriched its many
gardens, where vines clustered and roses revelled.
The pomegranate thrust up its ruddy blooms, and
glowed with the gilded roundness of its fruit.
The orange burdened its green canopies with gold.
The arbutus bled; the oleander blushed against the
blue. Like wine poured from heaven were the
sunsets upon the white pinnacles of the mountains.
Northwards flowed the woods, beating with leafy
billows on the walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agravale, rich city, possessed a duke in those
times, Raymond the Simple, a puppet prince
whose instincts were monastic, save in his obedience
to his wife. The Duchess Lilias kept her
husband like a half-tamed ape, mewed up in the
palace with baubles to trick his temper. He was
as weak of wit as he was feeble of limb, while
Lilias, proud Semiramis that she was, queened it
through all the Southern Marches. She was a
greedy dame, loose of mouth and loose of life.
Bishop Jocelyn was her confessor and her confidant.
The pair pandered to the passionate
temper of the city of Agravale, and were very
obedient to their Father the Pope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop and his companies had marched
back from the Seven Streams with much plunder
and honour, and the holy praise of Mother
Church. They had martyred and massacred, laid
waste the province, dangled their dogmas on the
points of their lances. There had been much
rejoicing at Agravale, much opening of wine
casks. Triumphant Masses had been sung in the
great cathedral of St. Pelinore. A tourney had
been held without the walls, for there was good
cause for pride and pleasure in Agravale. The
children of the south had upheld the Roman
Faith; their swords had shone in the cause of
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great inspiration of the city was a certain
passionate rivalry that existed between Bishop
Jocelyn and Lilias the Duchess. The pair diced
with gold, gambled with extravagance, for the
edification of the saints and the good people of
Agravale. When Dame Lilias laid out new
gardens with marble fountains and towers therein,
the Bishop out-gardened her by the magnificence
of three acres. When Jocelyn feasted all the
beggars of the city, the Duchess out-charitied him
with much silver and good cloth taken from her
coffers and her presses. The pair kept Agravale
a-bubble with their vanities. The Bishop would
have hired the angels out of heaven to out-dance
the wantons who tripped at the bidding of Lilias
the Duchess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rivalry between the pair had been exaggerated
the more by the swaggering quarrels of their
knights and mercenaries. Like hired gladiators,
they were ever ready to rend each other’s throats
in the cause of chivalry. It had so happened that
the Bishop’s champions had been worsted by
Lilias’s men in a late passage of arms without
the walls. Percival, captain of the ducal guards,
had unhorsed some dozen of the Bishop’s paladins
with his single spear. There had been great
wrath thereat in the episcopal palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One August morning, a bronzed, iron-faced
man entered the forecourt of the Bishop’s palace,
threaded his way through the loungers by the
stair leading to the inner gate. A guard met him
with crossed pike on the top step, bearing the
episcopal badge on the breast of his tunic, a
golden key in a mailed hand. Tristan, turning
a deaf ear to sundry witty gentlemen who were
sitting on the benches in the sun, told the guard
his business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend, I would see your captain of the
horse. Tell him a stranger has tramped leagues
to serve under him. Tristan le Sauvage is my
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard grounded his pike and stared
Tristan over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Ogier is at dinner,” quoth he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can listen the better, being so wholesomely
occupied. Come, friend, lead on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man took Tristan to a small room that was
joined to the guards’ hall by a winding stair. At
a table, with a page boy at his elbow, sat a giant
with a great hairy jowl, gigantic hands, and a
heavy paunch. He was gnawing a mutton bone
like a huge ogre, and had a tankard of ale at his
right hand. He stared Tristan over with his small,
close-set eyes, showed his teeth when he heard his
business. Ogier had been born a butcher’s son in
the distant north, and had carved out his fortune
by the sheer weight of his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, lad,” he said, smacking his lips and tossing
the bare bone upon the table, “you would
serve the Bishop and drink his beer? Good, very
good. Can you pay for your stomach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan showed the girth of his arm, the
knotted muscles swelling under the sleeve. Ogier
rose up, towering like a poplar over Tristan’s
head; his belt would have girded two common
men’s loins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child,” he said, setting a hairy hand on
Tristan’s shoulder, and leaning his great weight
thereon, “stand fast now; let me feel my prop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan never budged; he was like a stone
buttress against the flank of a tower, yet he rocked
a little as the giant bore on him. Ogier grinned,
puffed out his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Short men stand stiff,” he said. “Come, my
troll, we will try you further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you will,” was Tristan’s retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier thudded down by the winding stair, his
broad body shutting out the light. There was a
tilting yard joining the Bishop’s stables, and in
the yard stood a horse-block of solid stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lift it,” was all the giant said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan unstrapped his shield from betwixt his
shoulders, ungirded his sword, gave them Ogier
to hold. He spread his feet, tilted the stone, got
his fingers under the edge, held his breath, heaved
the mass over his head. The block splintered a
flagstone at Ogier’s feet. The giant blundered
back against the wall with an oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s truth, man!” he said. “Have a care
of my toes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now?” said Tristan, breathing hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier grinned and gripped his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the man,” he laughed, cracking
Tristan’s bones in his paw. “We will set you on
Percival, the Duchess’s lion. By my bones, you
will break the man over your knee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, lodged within the gates of the Bishop’s
palace, used eye and ear to gain some glint of
Rosamunde’s fair head, some breathing of her
name. Like a mirror he had to receive what passed
before him, silent and unstirred. Caution bridled
him, and he played his part like the dogged
adventurer that he was; had an open hand for
every man, scullion or squire, a smile for the
womenfolk who came out into the stable court to
giggle and gossip with the grooms and men-at-arms.
Ogier had taken him with some pride to
Bishop Jocelyn in his state closet. The churchman
had felt Tristan’s limbs with his soft,
womanly hands, and smiled over a strength that
was as prodigious as his own conceit. He was a
champion who should give Dame Lilias’s men the
lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of that proud woman, Rosamunde of Joyous
Vale, whom the Papists had snatched from him
in the gloom of the woods, Tristan won no word
or whisper. The men-at-arms of the palace spoke
often of their march through the province of the
Seven Streams. Many of the ruffians had carried
torches in the sacking of Ronan’s tower, yet of
Rosamunde and her fate the world seemed to have
no care. Tristan, with his ugly face inscrutable
as the face of a sphinx, watched and listened, bided
his time. If Rosamunde was in Agravale, he
would carry the gates of her prison off their
hinges, and set her free. Once again he would
look into those deep, wistful eyes, upon that face
whose petulant splendour haunted him night and
noon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was great love in his heart for Rosamunde.
It had grown and fed upon the stoutest
fibres of his heart. Her very name had taken root
about him, even as a red rose clambers about a
grave. Tristan was no visionary, no melancholy
worshipper of the stars. Life to him was action, a
bluff buffeting of waves, a gallop with the
wind. He was alive and lusty from the iron
sinews of his ankles to the corded muscles of
his throat. Superbly young, yet older in passion
than of yore, he took life cheerfully, knew no
defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Rosamunde, he loved her, and was not
ashamed of this same love. It was no enigma to
him, no subtle riddle begotten of a poet’s brain,
for to Tristan this love was as natural as life itself.
He loved the woods with their mysterious shadows,
the sea for its hoarse splendour, the flowers—even
because they were fair of face. In the same spontaneous
fashion he loved this woman, whose face
was beauty and whose lips were life. Above and
beyond this impulse towards joy, the deeper truths
were mellowing Tristan’s soul. He began to find
new glories in his strength, to cherish his manhood,
to build fast his honour. Since Rosamunde
was Rosamunde, should he not consecrate his
manhood to her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon had not changed her scimitar for a
silver shield before Tristan was proven both in
arms and faith. The women of Agravale were
bounteous beings, buxom and boisterous, red fruit
to be plucked from the tree of virtue. A red gown
trailed more than once round Tristan’s feet, and
youth had tempted him to merge youth in youth.
Yet he had shut his mouth, stiffened his head on
his massive neck, for Rosamunde’s face shone high
in the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for his courage, that was another matter.
Tristan could thrash a man, if he would not kiss
a woman, and Ogier took him often through Agravale
with half a score bravos at their back. They
swaggered through the streets, loitered in the
taverns, ogled such women as came their way.
More than once they met the Duchess’s men, and
shouldered them roughly to the wall. Ogier, the
butcher’s son, had a tussle in view, and Percival
of the Red Beard was to be brought to his
knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the square before the ducal palace, with
its pomegranates studded with golden fruit, its
rose trees and its acacias, ran a narrow passage-way
leading to the gardens of the abbey of St.
Pelinore. It was a shadowy place, flanked by high
walls of stone, arched above by the dense foliage
of chestnuts and great cedars. The path gave the
shortest track to such of the Duchess’s men who
returned from the lower city to the palace. Ogier
had watched this “run” of late, eager to catch
Knight Percival in a lane where there was no
turning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near the vesper hour one evening, when
Ogier and Tristan turned from the palace square
into this stone-walled walk. A knot of the
Bishop’s men-at-arms had passed in before them;
their voices and footsteps echoed with a metallic
resonance betwixt the walls. Of a sudden there
was a clangour of arms at the far end of the
passage. Hoods and helmets hid the entry; a pike
or two bobbed and shimmered under the trees.
Ogier loosened his sword in its scabbard, warned
Tristan with a wink of the eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier’s men had met the ducal company in the
midst of the passage. There was a tossing up of
challenges that reverberated in the narrow throat
of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out, dogs, make way for the Duchess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold, sirs, you shall take the wall of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be damned, then, stand aside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief scrimmage, a swaying to and
fro from wall to wall. A sword shone out in the
gleam from the west. A tall man in a trellised
hauberk, with a red tunic showing beneath, broke
through the press, and came striding on with his
chin in the air, his red moustachios curling up
like the tusks of a boar. He twirled his sword,
while his tawny eyes flashed rapid glances over
Ogier’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier spread his great arms from wall to wall,
thrust one foot forward, and barred the way.
Percival of the Red Beard made a sweeping
gesture with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of the path, wine skin,” he said, “or I
will set you leaking over the stones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Church before State, my friend,” said the
giant, standing firm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out, dogs, the Duchess is at hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devil take her,” was Ogier’s retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a blow from sword, a blow that
Ogier caught upon his shield. Tristan, stooping,
dodged under the giant’s arm, sprang at Knight
Percival before he could gain his guard. He had
his bear’s grip on the man’s body. A heave of
the chest, and the Knight of the Red Beard was
off his feet. An impotent waving of a sword, a
dropped shield, a straining of sinews, and Percival
crashed over Tristan’s head. His face struck the
stones; he squirmed over and lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier brandished the rest of them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Room for the Duchess,” he roared. “Come,
madame, we are the Bishop’s men; though we fight
your fellows, we serve the Duke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, standing over Percival’s body, saw a
short, plump woman move through the lane of
armed men. Two young girls carried the train of
her purple gown. She had a round, pallid face,
eyes of greyish green, somewhat protuberant, but
very liquid. The eyebrows sloped outwards over
the eyes. The nose was broad, with nostrils wide
apart; the mouth large, with lustful lips. Her
neck had a peculiar silken brilliancy; her bust was
full, her hips very broad. It was Lilias herself,
Duchess of Agravale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier saluted her, and lowered his point. Two
of the men-at-arms had raised Percival up; he was
bleeding about the face, for the fall had stunned
him. Lilias’s eyes were on Tristan’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ogier,” she said, speaking very rapidly, as
was her wont, with much working of the lips, “you
of the Bishop’s household are for ever picking
quarrels with my gentlemen. See to it, Sir
Butcher; you shall hear more of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier, ignoring her taunt against his origin,
covered his heart with his hairy paw, turned back
her wrath with a suave and ponderous unction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, madame,” he said, “your men persecute
us, have beaten us often, methinks, because your
gracious self lives in the heart of each of your
knights. If I served such a lady as the Duchess
Lilias, by God and the prophets, I could thrash
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman smiled a little, the smile of one to
whom flattery was never gross. Even a great dolt
such as Ogier could fool her with a few honeyed
antics of the tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of my poor Percival?” she said, stooping
and looking in the fallen man’s face. “Pah,
how a red nose spoils a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would have split my poor carcass,” said
Ogier, standing at her side, “had not my new
Hercules pitched him like a sack of flour over
his head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lilias turned, stood at her full height, and
looked Tristan over. She was a woman who loved
muscle and strength in a man, and that flippant
insolence that makes for pleasure. Tristan’s ugly
face had a peculiar charm, a virile fascination in
its uncomely vigour. Lilias smiled at him with
her glassy eyes, gathered her gown close about
her hips. She expected homage, but found not a
flash of it. Tristan met her look for look, a frown
on his face, his arms folded firmly over his chest.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was but two days after his breaking of Sir
Percival, that Tristan, idling through Agravale,
saw before him the open door of the great church
St. Pelinore. From the gloom within came the
scent of incense and the sound of the chanting of
the Mass. Tristan could see tapers shining on
the high altar in the choir. Women were passing
in and out, and two blind beggars sat at the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, moved more by curiosity than by the
desire for worship, entered in and uncovered his
head. The rounded vault was painted vermilion
and gold; the huge pillars of white stone were
banded with silver and inlaid with stones. The
basins for holy water were of black marble, their
dark pools gleaming with the colours of the roof.
Many chapels opened on either hand, dim sanctuaries
steeped in vapour of gold and of rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, rugged islander, had never looked
upon the like before. The place was full of that
subtle beauty conceived and wrought by the mind
of man. A strange idealism had sanctified the
saints and dowered each relic with a magic
mystery. The splendour of the place touched
Tristan’s soul. Nothing in Joyous Vale had
equalled this in pomp and magnificence, in form
and colour. And yet the afterthought dethroned
the spell. Was not Rosamunde’s gracious body
fairer far than this great church?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan took his stand by one of the great
pillars, and setting his back to it, looked round the
place. In the nave there was a stone pattern
wrought in the floor, known in Agravale as the
Penitent’s Rosary. There were some ten women
moving round and round, halting over each great
bead to breathe a prayer through silent lips.
Tristan watched them as they circled round with
bowed heads and folded hands, moving where the
sunlight streamed from the tall windows overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was conscious suddenly that one of these
dames was not wholly absorbed in prayer under
her hood. A round white chin was tilted significantly
under a pouting mouth, and two watchful
eyes considered him with a suggestiveness that no
man could mistake. As the woman circled over
the stones, walking slowly in her grey mantle that
but half hid the richer stuffs beneath, Tristan felt
that her eyes held his, and that her thoughts were
very far from heaven. The truth came to him as
he watched her glide over the stones of the great
rosary. It was Lilias herself who did penance
there, penance with her feet, but not with her
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due season the Duchess had ended her
pilgrimage, and stood with her hood turned back,
looking at Tristan across the church. Her women
had gathered about her, and outside the gates
Tristan saw the spear points of her guard. Turning,
with a glance cast at him over her shoulder,
she swept in state out of St. Pelinore’s, her women
following her, save one young girl who loitered
at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, with his broad back resting against
the pillar, stood thinking of the woman’s face
tinted by the light reflected from the crimson lining
of her hood. Her eyes had challenged him even
as they had done in that narrow passage when
Percival lay senseless in the dust. They puzzled
Tristan—these same eyes; for they had no depth
to harbour pity, and their shallow glances spoke
of no high mood. Different was Rosamunde from
this pale, sensuous dame whose scented garments
perfumed the very church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was roused out of his reverie by a small
hand plucking at his sleeve. By the pillar stood
a dark-eyed girl, half child, half woman, thin,
and a little sad. There was a timid smirk on her
childish face as she looked at Tristan and gave
her message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow my mistress,” were her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stared down at her, his ugly face bathed
in the sunlight that streamed from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom do you serve, child?” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lilias the Duchess,” came the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would your lady ask of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl tittered and coloured before him,
shamed, as it were, by the man’s straight stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are Tristan of the Bishop’s guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Tristan,” he answered her simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are to come with me,” she persisted,
touching his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s mouth hardened as he considered
her message, still leaning his weight against the
pillar. What was Tristan to Lilias, or Lilias to
Tristan? She was a woman, and a bad one, so
he had gathered since he had sojourned in the city.
Yet she ruled Agravale, and in her ruling was
wise in the secrets of the south. In some vague
way he even imagined that he might win news of
her whom he sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Tristan followed the girl from the church,
and crossing the great court that lay without,
entered the gardens of St. Pelinore. Mulberry
trees towered above the lawns, studded thick with
ripening fruit. Weeping ashes glittered there,
and figs and cedars cast their shade over broad
beds of mint and thyme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl watched Tristan as she walked beside
him, holding a little apart, with one hand to her
cheek. She was a sharp wench enough, and
Agravale had taught her to take the measure of
a man. Therefore she studied Tristan’s face, that
she might read his strength or weakness therein
by the dogged set of the strong jaw, the keen eyes,
the firm, clean mouth. She began to speak to him
as they crossed the gardens with a coy simplicity
that was well assumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are strange to Agravale?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan looked at her slantwise over his
shoulder, for she seemed but a child untouched by
guile. Her glances wandered over the great
trees, and the flowers that grew in the short
grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would prosper?” she asked him tentatively,
casting about in her mind how she might
win his trust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have begun passably,” said Tristan, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For you humbled Percival. Ah, how strong
you must be! I am almost afraid, sir, when I
look at your great arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mild eyes trembled up innocently to
Tristan’s. The flattery seemed so spontaneous in
her words that it would have puzzled a young man
to have uncovered her cunning. Nor was Tristan
unwilling to seem strong to her, for youth takes
pride in its great strength. For the moment he
was half tempted to question her concerning Rosamunde
of the Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be a great knight in Agravale,” the
girl said to him, with a shy smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so, sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, sir, are you blind? Know you not that
a woman loves not a beaten man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You trampled down Percival. The Duchess
would have you serve her in his stead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stared at him, and for the moment lost
her mask of innocence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you not ambitious?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am young, good sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a mighty man, though young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem zealous for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I serve my lady. Why, it will be all plain
for you. Is it so strange a thing to serve a
woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left the gardens and come to a high
stone wall that skirted the precincts of Lilias’s
palace. Cypresses and bays showed above the
stone, while a great cedar cast a broad shadow
there. In the wall there was a little door studded
over with iron nails. The girl took a key that
hung at her girdle, unlocked the door, and pointed
Tristan in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter, sir,” she said, with a glib smile and
a slight bending of her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood and looked through under the
lintel. He could see a garden spread within, the
grass sleek under the noonday sun, beds of flowers,
purple and red. At the end of a lawn stood an
orange thicket, and under the trees a woman
walked, clad in crimson, with her white arms bare.
She wore sandals of gold stuff on her naked feet
and her hair hung loose about her neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tristan turned back from the door and
looked full into the girl’s dark eyes. She coloured
a little under his gaze, as though half guessing
what was in his heart, and that he knew the part
she played. Nor was he slow to read the truth
that shone for him on her thin, pale face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will speak to my lady for me,” he said
to her, casting a swift glance into the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at him, but did not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, sir, shall I say?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will not enter yonder place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, for the youth in me will not serve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face changed suddenly like a fickle sky,
and she began to mock him as he stood before
her, thrusting her tongue out and beating her
hands. To Tristan she seemed like some sly elf
changed from a child to an evil imp, as he turned
and left her by the wall with a grim frown on his
ugly face.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When Tristan returned to the Bishop’s palace,
he found two horses standing saddled and bridled
in the inner court. One of them was Tristan’s,
a raw-boned roan with one white foot and a white
muzzle. A man-at-arms, half asleep on a bench
at the bottom of the guard-room stair, scrambled
up when he saw Tristan, and opened a great
mouth with the gusto of a news-teller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, laggard! Ogier has been calling for
you this hour or more, blaspheming you till the
stones blushed. Above with you, if you would
hear good downright cursing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan passed through the guard-room, found
Ogier striding to and fro in his closet, armed for
riding, the froth from a tankard still on his beard.
He unbosomed himself when Tristan entered, like
a volcano to whom periodic outbursts were the
natural vent of much accumulated spleen. Tristan
let the giant’s cursing pass over him like water.
He gained time by sitting down before Ogier’s
table and finishing the remnants of that gentleman’s
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feed away, my son,” said the giant, with his
hand on the tankard; “you can keep your mouth
shut, I guess, when it is a matter of discretion.
You and I ride out with Jocelyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I not an image that beholds and sees
not?” said Tristan from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, lad, you will stand in need of blindness
to-night. The Bishop will amuse himself. And
to be honest, he can out-devil all the Gadarene
swine when the fit is on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” he said, “I am getting grey, and
I have seen many strange sights in my time. It
has always puzzled me to discover where the devil
all that virtue hides itself which the priests prate
of, mostly to the women. Silence. Behold the
virtue, my son, necessary to the honest fellow who
would fill his pockets from the coffers of the
Church. Come, now, I hear the trumpet in the
court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn, Bishop of Agravale, had possessed
himself of some persuasions of piety in the hearts
of the innocents to whom he ministered. He was
a man who believed at least in cleansing the outside
of the pot. To rule by means of the prerogative
of righteousness, a man needs some little
reputation for that virtue. And since the robes
and insignia of office were scrupulously cleansed
and burnished, Jocelyn found opportunities to
pander in secret to the inner man. There was a
subtle conviction in him that to be able to resist
the devil, one must bow down and propitiate him
at stated intervals. The occasional lapse made the
intervening virtue the more easy. Priest that he
was, he could not pose eternally, even to himself,
as a species of waxen image in which the virile
blood had been turned to milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was publicly acknowledged in Agravale that
the good Bishop rode regularly into the wilderness
to eat grass like Nebuchadnezzar in order to purge
the brain of the vain follies of human pride. He
held long vigils in the woods, so his people believed;
played the hermit under the winking stars.
It was whispered that celestial visions had been
spread before his eyes, that St. Pelinore had come
down and walked the earth with him to his great
comfort. Like Elijah in the wilderness, he was
sustained by the grace of heaven, and by the dew
of sanctity that descended upon his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Ogier and Tristan followed him that day
from Agravale, two stalwart exemplars of the
Church Militant. The Bishop rode a mouse-coloured
mare, trapped with red harness and a
saddle of carved ivory. He wore a plain black
robe with a sable hood and a black mask over his
face. Ogier rode a great white stallion, a huge
beast, the only horse in Agravale who could bear
his bulk. Tristan, with his red shield strapped
between his shoulders and the episcopal white
surcoat over his hauberk, rode beside Ogier on
this saintly pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three sallied from Agravale, leaving its
white walls that climbed to the very verge of the
great southern precipice. Its towers and turrets
ascended towards the blue. Northwards the woods
bristled under the sun, a glitter like blackened
steel under the summer sky. The road wound
under ancient trees. Many a huge ilex cast its
gloom over the grass. The stone pine towered on
the hills above the dense woods of beech and chestnut,
and the valleys were full of primeval oaks,
whose sinewy limbs stretched far over the sun-streaked
sward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Tristan, his mood partook of the silence
of the woods. He was thinking of the Duchess
Lilias, that she was not a dame to be flouted with
impunity, nor one who could forgive the starving
of her desire. Though the summer was flying
he had no news of Rosamunde. So utterly had
she vanished from the ken of the world, that some
Old Man of the Sea might have mured her in a
cave under amber-bosomed waves. That she was
dead Tristan would not believe. There was an
instinctive faith within his heart that Rosamunde
lived, perhaps to her greater misery. Ogier himself
might have the secret locked in his ungainly
carcass, yet Tristan had no desire to betray his
quest before he could mend matters to his
credit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn had little to say to the pair as they
rode through the wilds together. Once free of
Agravale, he had put the mask from off his face,
and rode with his cowl turned back, his sleek and
sensuous face white in the sun. Tristan saw him
smile often in a prophetic way, as though the
pilgrimage were much to his liking. In a wallet
at his saddle bow he had a flask of red wine, and
the churchman’s lips were often puckered round
the mouth of the flask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the day declined, they came to a wilder
region, where pines grew thick and cranberries
tufted half-hidden rocks. The track was a mere
grass ride, two cubits broad, where Ogier and
Tristan followed Jocelyn in single file. A desolate
valley opened gradually before them, steeped on
every side with the black umbrage of the woods.
To the west a craggy peak smote the setting sun.
In the lap of the valley lay a mere, an island
rising black and dim above the silvered surface.
Grassland gilded with asphodel dipped towards
the water. Yellow flags grew in the shallows;
there were lilies floating beyond the rushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun sank down behind the crag as the
three crossed the grassland towards the water.
Blood-red streamers streaked the sky; a golden
mist ascended towards the woods. The island in
the mere grew black as ebony, overarched by a
canopy of scarlet clouds. Tristan could see a
stone building rising from the island’s thickets,
and the place breathed forth mystery towards the
hastening night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier took a bugle horn that hung round his
neck, and blew three blasts that set the wild woods
ringing. At the sound a boat put out from the
island and moved over the smooth water towards
the bank. A strange babel of wild voices seemed
to fall as from the sky. Cries came as from lost
souls tortured in a burning pit. While Tristan
listened with a frown on his face, the cries died
down into the woodland silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barge was rowed by an old man, with a
beak of a nose, fierce, restless eyes, and a mouth
like a flint. As the barge ran to the stage, the
old man let a horse-board down. The barge could
bear but one of them at a time. Tristan and the
giant waited at the water’s edge while the boat
bore Jocelyn over the water, to where the island
rose sable as the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s brows were knotted above his eyes.
The mystery of the place had set him musing,
casting about for Jocelyn’s reason in riding into
such a wilderness. He questioned Ogier as they
watched the barge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have we come?” he asked, with a keen
stare into the giant’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier grinned and licked his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men call it the Mad Mere,” he said. “Yonder
house is a hospital for such as froth at the mouth
when the moon is full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that clamour when you blew your horn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mad folk squealing. Old Nicholas
chastens them often with his whip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan still gazed at the island under his heavy
brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my lord the Bishop?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” quoth Ogier, with one of his grins,
“if you are ambitious, keep your tongue from
stealing the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have done with your damned riddles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son, Master Jocelyn refreshes himself
after the dull services of sanctity. Keep your eyes
open and your mouth shut. You shall behold how
frail are the feet of the holy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I grow wise—in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten thousand devils, man, you shall see such
sights as shall make you grow green as an unripe
fig. Keep your mouth shut in Agravale, and you
will prosper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barge drifted back to them, and Tristan
took the next passage, waited by the landing stage
while this grey Charon ferried Ogier and his white
horse over. Tristan had cast rapid glances round
him as he waited. The place was built of rough-hewn
stone, walled in on every side, with narrow
squints for windows. Cypresses and yews grew
close about the walls. The gate was flanked by a
stone tower, standing black and sullen against the
sky. Ever and again an eerie whimper came from
the place, or a wild medley of voices, more like
the chattering of a band of apes. There were three
more horses tethered in a roughly thatched hovel
under a walnut tree. A man was asleep there on
a pile of hay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier landed, dragged the white stallion from
the barge by the bridle. The ferryman took the
horses, when he had made the boat fast to a great
stake by the stage. Ogier knew the ways of the
madhouse well enough; Tristan gathered as much
as they passed in together under the low arch of
the gate. A narrow courtyard held the centre of
the building, with barred windows opening upon
it on every side. In the centre of the court stood
a great whipping-post with iron wristlets dangling
from a rusty chain. Tristan saw all these things
as his eyes darted rapid glances hither and thither
in the half gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they passed through the court, a sudden
clamour arose at the narrow windows overhead,
where white faces were pressed against the bars.
The grated windows seemed filled with mad eyes
and dishevelled hair. The beings mured there were
as wild beasts starving in a cage. Their cries
reverberated through the well of the court, dinning
their frenzy into Tristan’s ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier passed into a room opening by a short
passage from the court. It looked like a species
of guard-room or antechamber, leading by a flight
of low steps to a larger room above. A door fitted
with an iron grille closed the stairway at the top.
In the lower room a fire burned upon the hearth; a
meal had been spread on a rough table, and the
place was lit by a single iron lamp hanging from
the ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier unbuckled his sword and flung it with a
crash upon a wooden settle. He was hot and out
of temper. Drawing a stool to the table, he began
to eat like a hungry wolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fall to, my son,” he said, flourishing a pot
in his right hand; “we shall be on guard all night.
Come, keep up your courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan joined him. They ate in silence, listening
to the vague and unhallowed sounds that
echoed now and again through this habitation of
the mad. Tristan was debating with himself as
to what had become of Jocelyn the Bishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they sat at meat, the sound of a melody
played by a rebec and flute quivered down from
the upper room. A thrill of laughter stirred in the
air; streaks of yellow light poured betwixt the
hinges and under the planking of the door. The
music increased, as though some blithe company
descended to a feast; while within, a man’s gruff
voice broke forth into a song. The crabbed and
grizzled ferryman came in from the court, and sat
down on a stool before the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan leant over the table, laid a hand upon
Ogier’s wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are yonder folk mad—also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant grinned and held up a pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad, my son, most mad,” he said; “when the
wine flows, you will hear them cackling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman’s voice rose in discord to the music,
a wild and abandoned scream of inarticulate
laughter. Half a dozen tongues seemed to gather
in a chorus. The laughter died down, rose again
into a squeal of mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Bishop and Black Benedict enjoy themselves,”
said Ogier, licking his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rose up, thrusting aside his stool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God,” he said, “I will look through yonder
grille.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier plunged forward and barred his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, my son,” he said, with a bending of the
brows, “wait till they are drunk enough. Then,
by my soul, you shall look at your leisure.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan faced Ogier for the moment as though
more than tempted to hold him in defiance. He
remembered, however, that the giant was worth
more to him as a friend than as an enemy; and
making a laugh of the matter, he picked up the
stool and returned to his supper. Old Nicholas
by the fire had watched them with a dull grin on
his ferocious and toad-like face. He poked the
embers with a charred stake, winked at Ogier, and
waxed witty over the strenuousness of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young blood runs hot, sirs,” he said, “and
prithee, what is this chivalry men prate about but
youth gone mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, old raven, we are all mad to you, since
you are scourging lunatic folk all the days of your
life. All creation’s moonstruck to an owl hooting
in a chimney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis only like drink,” said the ferryman.
“Some are quickly overset; others swim in wine—’tis
their natural element. All men are mad in
measure. These mad folk have more spirit than
body; you, Messire Ogier, have more body than
spirit. The flesh overbalanceth the spirit, and
your fat paunch keeps out the vapours. It is good
in season to make of one’s soul a toad under a
stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man sniggered, stretched himself, took
a knotted whip from the wall, and passed out by
a narrow door set back in the thickness of the wall.
There was something so evil and repulsive about
the creature that the room felt warmer to Tristan
when he had gone. Ogier had stretched himself
on a settle before the fire, for though it was summer,
a cold mist rose from off the mere. Ogier, with
his carcass propped before the glow, blinked and
dozed after his superhuman meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, sitting by the table with his chin upon
his fists, kept wide awake and listened. The fire
flung huge shadows about the walls; the smoke-grimed
roof was steeped in gloom. From the
room beyond the closed and gridded door the mirth
grew more boisterous as the night wore on. Music
and mad laughter mingled in a riotous flux of
sound, while ever and again a woman’s squeal
would top the din. In that dark, firelit room
Tristan’s manhood gathered fanaticism for the
future, and he began to understand the more why
Samson had blasphemed against the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier had fallen asleep upon the settle. Tristan
saw the man’s stout chest heaving to and fro like
a smith’s bellows. The sound of his snoring
seemed to shake the room, as the breath rattled
and bubbled in his throat. Ogier’s huge mouth
was open, his fangs gleaming above his uncleanly
beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rose from the table with his eyes on
the sleeping man. Holding the scabbard of his
sword, he climbed the stairway, pushed back the
grille, looked through into the inner room. A
stream of light gushed through the grating upon
his face, with odours of wine and cooked meats
and of scented garments. The scene within was
more like some classic orgy than the breaking of
bread by a Christian Bishop. Couches were spread
upon the floor about a low table covered with
flowers. Lamps hung from the roof, hooded with
crimson cloth. Goblets and silver chargers bearing
fruit and rich food stuff gleamed in the light
of the lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the room, half lying in a woman’s
lap, was Jocelyn of Agravale with a garland of
vine leaves about his forehead. His face was
suffused, his eyes bright with the fumes of wine.
The woman beside him was robed in scarlet, arms
and shoulders bare and white, a wreath of roses
over her raven hair. To the right of the Bishop
sprawled Benedict of the Marches, a brown-eyed
wench leaning on his shoulder and pouring wine
over his head. There were three more women
about the table, whose charms were sacred to
Benedict’s two esquires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, very grim about the mouth, closed the
grille, and sprang down the stairs. He had seen
enough to disgust his manhood, for, bred in the
strong, clean lap of the sea, he had little understanding
of such sins as these. Perhaps in his
heart he had feared to find Rosamunde in that
company of the saints. Not that he doubted her,
for his faith was not feeble in the matter of her
honour. Yet, with such holy rogues as Jocelyn
ruling the land, some hideous tyranny might have
brought her low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier was still snoring on the settle before the
fire, and Tristan strode up and down with the
ruddy glow playing and sparkling upon his
hauberk. The laughter and bursts of music came
more crazed and disjointed to his ears. His cheeks
tingled, his hands quivered for the sword. What
if Jocelyn, hypocritical sensualist that he was,
had Rosamunde imprisoned and in his power?
Perhaps she was under this very roof, mewed
amid madmen and beings bereft of all cleanly
and regenerating reason. Tristan could not suffer
such thoughts as these. He glared at Ogier
sleeping by the fire, as though ready to throttle
him as he slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A distant clamour in the house stayed him in
his stride for the moment, and Tristan heard
blows given, a rough voice cursing as in furious
wrath. Screams came ebbing from some cell or
passage overhead. There was the rush of feet
down stone stairs, a panting outcry, a scraping of
fingers along the walls of a dark gallery. The
door jerked open. A young girl with her hair
tangled over her face ran into the room, stared
round her like a hunted thing hounded into a
trap. Her ragged gown reached only to her knees,
and she pressed the rotten cloth over her bosom
with both hands. Bloody weals showed on her
bare shoulders; her eyes were wide and piteous
with fear. Even as she stood there shivering like
a reed, Nicholas the warden came in, his teeth
agleam, his whip swinging in his hand. Breathing
hard, he made at the girl, smote at her, once,
twice, while she cowered beneath the lash, holding
up her hands to break the blows. Tristan’s blood
was up on the instant. He sprang on Nicholas,
took him by the waist, hurled him heavily along
the floor. The girl, with but half a glance at
Tristan, turned and fled back through the door,
while Ogier, waking with the din, scrambled up,
rubbing his eyes with his hairy paws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thousand curses! What are you at, lad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Breaking that old wolf’s head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pah, he has no muscle for such as you.
You’re drunk, I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. The old cur was scourging a woman
with a whip. That is not my fashion. I pitched
him over into yonder corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier bent over Nicholas, raised his shoulders
from the floor. The old man groaned a little,
bled at the mouth, still held the whip clutched in
his right hand. Ogier called for wine. Tristan,
very grim, brought him the flask, but would not
minister to Nicholas with his own hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Peter, my son,” said Ogier, from the
floor, “you have come nigh breaking our grandfather’s
neck. Hold up, gaffer; swallow some of
this strong stuff. Take his heels, you dolt; we’ll
lay him on the settle by the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between them they carried Nicholas to the
settle, dribbled wine between his teeth, saw his
lids quiver as he began to recover from the throw.
Tristan had taken the old man’s whip. He broke
it like a reed, and threw the fragments into the
fire. Ogier, rising from his knees beside the
settle, scowled at him with his small flesh-hidden
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and cool your blood in the court, my
son,” he said; “you are too ready with those hands
of yours. Discipline is my creed. Mad folk must
be kept in order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the whip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How else, you soft pate? Old Nicholas must
drive the devil out of them with whipcord, or
they would tear him limb from limb. The man
cannot tongue-tag with idiots. You will have to
tan your heart leather better, friend Tristan, if
you are to serve Jocelyn of Agravale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan turned away with a great effort, and
began to pace up and down the room. He
could not trust himself to look at Ogier for the
moment. The giant’s arrogance of bulk made
Tristan’s arms tingle to come to a grip with him.
Presently he passed out into the court, felt the
cool breath of the night playing upon his face.
The stars were shining overhead; only an occasional
whimper came from the barred windows in
the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole sky rocked above his head, and he
was as a man struggling in a whirlpool of opposing
impulses. He was half moved to charge in, slay
Ogier and Nicholas, put Jocelyn and Benedict to
the sword. Yet even if he purged the place, what
then? Would he be nearer Rosamunde or
Columbe, his lost sister? As for these mad folk,
they would be as ready to rend him in all likelihood
as old Nicholas who handled the whip.
Reasonless miserables that they were, they would
but starve and turn upon each other like wolves
loosed suddenly from a cage. And the women,
these flowers of passion? They were Jocelyn’s
creatures, content to work his will, and what was
barren liberty to them? They would have mocked
him as men mocked Noah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s brain cooled in the night air. There
were the constant stars above him, the dim clouds
sweeping pure athwart the sky. He would gain
yet more by silence than by some outburst of
physical protestation. What if he slew Ogier and
Jocelyn also, would he be the wiser as to Rosamunde’s
fate? The time of his patient apprenticeship
had not yet elapsed, and the surest fortitude
still lay in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow filled the doorway leading to the
guard-room. Ogier stood there, stretching his
arms heavenwards, yawning like a volcano. He
saw Tristan, and called to him out of the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, my son, have you cooled your flesh by
now? Your fingers itch too incontinently for other
people’s weasands. Old Nicholas is himself again,
save for a bruised face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan conjured up a laugh and fell in with
Ogier’s humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It goes against the grain with me,” he said,
“to see a girl flogged. God knows, she is mad,
and the rod is the only argument.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women, my son,” said Ogier, striding up like
a great galleon, and buffeting Tristan’s shoulder,
“women are like dogs, the better for a beating.
They make fools of us, the wantons, but, by
Jeremy, we have the heavier hand of them. Consider
Master Jocelyn. Ha, I was forgetting. Did
you look through that grille?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, quick to comprehend his part, nudged
Ogier significantly with his elbow. The giant
broke into a chuckle, a sound that echoed through
the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See how our saints have feet of clay,” he
said. “My faith, comrade, but the Bishop is a
bigger fool than any of us. He would out-Solomon
Solomon for a black eye and a red
mouth. Tristan, my son, if you love peace, keep
clear of petticoats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truth, truth,” said the disciple, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier stretched himself again and yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my son, we are the ministers of love. To
horse, and away at dawn. Such are our orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jocelyn returns to Agravale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast, sir. Do pigs eschew a clover
rick? No, no; ’tis we who ride, and not the
Bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Agravale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the devil, sir, with Agravale. There might
be some sly wench there, by the way you seem
to dote on the city. No, my son, we ride yet
deeper into the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan turned suddenly upon his heel, and
stared Ogier full between the brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More madhouses?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier chuckled, and smote him with his fist
upon the chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember, good lad,” he said, “that the dear
Bishop rideth on a pastoral pilgrimage for the
redemption of the afflicted. There is a certain
comely heretic who needs his holy ministrations.
Of her, more anon. We, sir, are good Jocelyn’s
forerunners to prepare him a welcome. Come, I
see a grin on the sky’s face. The dawn is rushing
up. Let us go and eat, lad, before we sally.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Ogier sallied at dawn, old Nicholas
ferrying them over the mere one by one. The
man had recovered his wits, if not his good will,
and his small eyes darted furtive gleams at Tristan,
as though he were ready to knife him if the chance
had offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wind had risen in the night, brisk and eager
as a blithe breath from the sea. The clouds raced
athwart the blue; shadows scampered over the
grass; the trees shook their heads and laughed.
The water was smitten into a thousand golden
wrinkles by the wind. The lilies danced in the
shallows; the rushes shivered as the ripples
plashed amid the sedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Ogier and Tristan got to horse, a last shrill
clamour reached them from the madhouse in the
mere. A swift swirl of sound, wild and wordless;
it was the wailing of the wretches mocked in
their dark dens by the ever-returning dawn. To
Tristan the air seemed cleaner since he had crossed
the water; the dawn had a deeper gold, the sky a
richer colour. The trees cheered him, waved their
dark green shields. “Rosamunde, Rosamunde,
Rosamunde!” cried the wind. All the alleys and
wells of that deep wild seemed to breathe adventure
and to mouth romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The valley, with its dark pines and stunted
olives, sank back under the dawn, while the madhouse
stood like black marble in a sheet of gold.
Rabbits scurried into the thickets. A herd of
swine ran from them, squealing and grunting
into the gloom. Wild life was with Tristan, the
solitary piping of the birds. The wilderness
seemed part of his own soul, where strength
and grim nature flourished in the good prime of
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier was in a coarse, boastful mood that
morning. What little spirit he had seemed to
smack of the wine-cask and the brothel. He
twitted Tristan, jested against the Bishop, let his
loose tongue revel over unclean food. The man
was a mere mountain of flesh, corrupt and
noisome, and Tristan glanced over his carcass
with the grim glee of a smiter. He marked the
man’s fat and ungainly girth, smiled when he
pictured his good sword falling across the giant’s
throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, lad,” said Ogier, in his ranting mood,
“what though I am a butcher’s son, I am not
ashamed of the shambles. I have eaten good meat
in my time, and drunk such wine as warms the
belly. This great carcass of mine has served me
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A stout arm, comrade, and a stout sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, there is not a fellow in the south who
can match me in arms. Goliath, why, I would
have cloven that Philistine to the chin. As for
you, my little one, I could break your back as I
could wring the neck of a pigeon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless, doubtless,” said Tristan, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was content to listen to the man’s vapourings,
for if Ogier waxed garrulous, so much the
better. He might betray himself and Jocelyn
also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To serve the Church, sir,” Ogier ran on,
“you must play the pander and keep your mouth
shut like an alms coffer. I have been purveyor
to the Bishop. Wine, meat, gold, glory, love,
and the like—why, sir, I have played with them
all, and to my credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the needful wit in you,” said
Tristan, with something of a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Youngling, well said; you could do worse
than follow my lead. A heavy hand and an iron
heart; these things serve. Nor have I stinted
myself in obeying the Bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You farm his taxes, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And take my own toll, man. Jocelyn’s none
the wiser. I play the Bishop before him, and he
pays the cost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The land dropped before them to a wooded
plain, grassland and thickets interspersed together.
Great cedars grew there, and huge primeval oaks.
Tristan printed the map upon his mind, as he rode
on Ogier’s flank, keeping his bearing by the sun.
To the north a line of hills towered up, wooded
below, bare-fanged above. All about was the blue
gloom of the far unknown, and the wilderness
smiled under the hurrying sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This second hermitage,” said Tristan, playing
with his bridle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier licked his lips with his great red tongue,
smoothed his coarse beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therein, sir,” he answered, “Jocelyn has
caged his latest captive. Mark the quip, my
friend. She is a white heretic from the Seven
Streams. Scold that she is, I have great hopes
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed and grimaced in Tristan’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another damsel queened it there before,
brother,” he continued. “Of her, I guess, there
was some tragic end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?” asked Tristan, growing the keener
as he listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier edged his horse round a fallen tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before Lententide,” he said, slouching lazily
in the saddle, “I was sent by ship with certain
priests to a northern province to treat with Blanche
the Bold, who is a duchess there. Ha, but she
would have none of our treaties. Sailing home
with a good west wind, we ran by an island—Purple
Isle, as my sea-dogs said, far out to sea.
Our casks were low, so we landed to win water.
By a spring near the shore my fellows caught a
chit of a girl with as pert a face and as trim a
body as I ever saw in Agravale. ‘So ho,’ thought
I, ‘here is good merchandise to please the Bishop.’
Ha, brother, but I sold her to Jocelyn for two
hundred silver crowns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, with a sudden grimness in his eyes,
twitched at his bridle and drew a yard nearer to
the man on the white stallion. So tightly were
Tristan’s lips pressed together that they formed
a pouting line above his chin. The muscles were
knotted about the angle of his jaw. He would
not trust his tongue for the moment, lest the truth
should out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good bargain, comrade,” he said, grinding
his teeth, every sinew of him taut as the fibres
of a wind-rocked tree, “a good bargain. And the
girl, what of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier laughed. His great red mouth gaped
above his beard, and there was an unclean glint
in his wolfish eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was good food,” he said. “I had my fill
before she came to the Bishop’s table. Bah! we
soldiers have our turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s hand was on his sword. The muscles
of his arm tightened, then relaxed. He shut his
eyes for the moment, saw blood against the sun.
Yet, from mere molten wrath, his vengeance
hardened to metal at white heat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of the girl?” he asked again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier puffed out a deep breath, wiped his
mouth on the back of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil knows,” he said, jerking his thumb
over his right shoulder. “For a month she was
in the madhouse yonder; the girl was too much a
lamb for the she-wolves there. Jocelyn had her
sent to the haunt we ride to. She was no longer
flaunting it when the White Heretic took her
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?” said Tristan, with a great gulp of
fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask Jocelyn, my son,” quoth Ogier, with a
callous sniff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to a great wood that climbed
into the blue distance, clouding the bosoms of the
hills. From the dense and mysterious umbrage
of the trees a broad stream glittered, winding
southwards into the green. A narrow grass ride
delved beside the water into the woods. Ogier
plunged in, with Tristan at his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” said the giant, over his shoulder,
oblivious of the sword that tingled in its scabbard,
“if the Bishop’s business takes you this way
once more, follow the river; it will guide you
straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, comrade,” said Tristan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have fun anon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the White Heretic, eh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my bones, lad, she is as cold as a block
of marble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broad glade opened sudden before them, its
grassy slopes shelving on the east towards the
river. Great oaks canopied it on every hand, the
sunlight sifting through in a thousand streams.
The mossy trunks stood hord on hord, while the
plash of the water played through the stagnant
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the upflashing of a sword, and a
hoarse challenge startled the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard, devil, guard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier, his great mouth wide, twisted round,
saw a furious face glaring dead white front under
the shadow of a shield. A sword streaked the
sunlight. Ogier blinked at Tristan as at one gone
mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damnation! What’s amiss, my son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the love of God, I have you now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool, are you mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hoarse voice echoed him; the eyes flashed
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard, ravisher, guard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten thousand devils! What have we here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan of Purple Isle, avenger of Columbe;
Tristan the Heretic, Tristan of the Seven Streams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ogier growled like a trapped bear. He whipped
his sword out, put forward his shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On with you, traitor!” he roared. “Join
your sister under the sods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, say you so?” said Tristan, closing in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief blundering tussle on horseback
under the trees. Ogier’s stallion seemed
overweighted by his bulk, and was slow to answer
the bridle as a waterlogged ship the helm. Tristan
caught Ogier on the flank, so that the giant could
not use his shield. Their swords flashed, yelped,
twisted in the air. A down cut hewed the dexter
cantel from Ogier’s shield. The giant’s face, with
a gashed cheek, glared at Tristan from under his
upreared arm. So close were they that blood
spattered Tristan’s face, as Ogier blew the red
stream from his mouth and beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan broke away, wheeled, and came again
with a cry of “Rosamunde!” He lashed home,
split Ogier’s collar bone even through the rings
of his hauberk. The giant yelped like a gored
hound, dropped his shield, parried a second cut,
smote Tristan’s horse above the ears. Tossing and
rearing under the trees, the brute was unmanageable
for the moment, and Tristan slipped from
the saddle, sprang back against a tree as Ogier
charged at him. The sword point whistled a
hand’s breadth from his face. Before Ogier could
wheel, Tristan was on him like a leopard. The
giant, gripped by the girdle, toppled back and
came down with a crash, his sword flashing from
his hand in the fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair were at grips upon the grass, where
Tristan, quick as a cat, came up on Ogier and
straddled his chest. The giant heaved at him,
gripped him by the knees. For one moment
Tristan fell aside, but he was up and above again,
with one hand on the other’s throat. Ogier,
straining, panting with his burden of flesh, went
down again under Tristan’s weight. He fought
with his feet, rolled to and fro like a rudderless
ship. Tristan, shortening his sword, ran the point
into Ogier’s throat. The giant’s hands clutched
and gripped the blade. There was a spasmodic
heave of the great body, a tense quivering of the
limbs, as the sword ran through, smote a cubit
or more into the grass beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, breathing hard, with his mouth wide
open, rose up slowly from the giant’s body.
Ogier had his death stroke; the red stream told
as much as he twitched awhile and then lay still.
Tristan, wiping the sweat from his forehead,
plucked his sword out by the hilt. Columbe of
Purple Isle was avenged of one foe.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing Tristan did after he had wiped his
sword on a grass tussock and set it in his sheath
was to look to the wound Ogier had dealt his horse.
The animal was standing under a tree, tossing its
head, rubbing its muzzle against the trunk.
Tristan had great tenderness for any dumb thing
in pain; moreover, he and the horse had come
south from Tor’s Tower together; they were good
comrades in the way of adventure. Tristan’s
voice, familiar and trusted, calmed the beast, so
that he suffered Tristan to gauge the wound.
There had been no great evil in the blow, for
Ogier’s sword, turned by the bone, had left a
slight gash and nothing more. Tristan comforted
the beast, fondling the muzzle, stroking the sleek
neck. He knotted the bridle over a bough, caught
Ogier’s white stallion, and tethered him also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next he took dead Ogier by the heels, dragged
him out of the pool of sunlight where he lay into
the shade of the solemn trees. For Ogier he felt
no pang of pity; the man was a mere mountain
of flesh, fit food for worms and ravens. Nevertheless,
he covered the face with the broken shield,
unbuckled Ogier’s girdle, and picked up his sword.
So much done, he went down to the river, and
washed the blood from his hands and face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mounting Ogier’s stallion, Tristan took his
own horse by the bridle, and followed the ride
beside the stream. His heart was great in him
that day, for the slaying of Ogier had warmed
his blood and the lust of battle still stirred within
him. His thoughts fled towards Columbe his
sister, and he prayed that her golden head might
gleam out before him from the greenwood shade.
If she lived, what great joy for a brother’s heart.
To feel her warm arms round his neck, to see her
child’s eyes flash to his. Columbe, the maid with
the smiling eyes, who had been his heart’s ease in
the days of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Rosamunde he thought but little for the
moment, for he had not slain Ogier for her sake.
It was as though she had stepped aside out of
his heart when he remembered Columbe and his
mother’s blessing. Yet like some fair queen she
should crown his honour and share with Columbe
the blessings of the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan came to a narrow valley, its grassland
golden with asphodel dipping down towards the
stream. Around, above, towered the ancient trees.
In the midst of the stream stood a goodly island,
bosomed in foam, hid by the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, halting under an oak, scanned the
valley under his hand. Gazing over the grassland,
his eyes discovered a grey wall linking the scattered
rocks, girding the island under the shadows of its
trees. He saw the glint of a red roof under the
green. Though there was no bridge to span the
water Tristan doubted not that this was the
Bishop’s hermitage, “Jocelyn’s dovecot,” as dead
Ogier had said. He tethered his two horses under
the trees where they would not be seen by folk on
the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the shade, he went full length and
crawled through the tall rank grass like a leopard
stalking its prey. Soon he heard the gush and
thunder of the stream, as it raced and foamed over
rock and boulder. Lifting his head slowly from
the grass, he scanned the island under his hand.
So snugly was the house hid amid the rocks and
trees that Tristan had to delve for it even as a
hawk searches the long grass for crouching prey.
The stone wall was so cunningly ranged above
the rocks that it seemed part and parcel of the
isle itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan scrambled down the bank and plunged
into the torrent. It was shallow yet treacherous.
The water foamed about his knees; pebbles and
boulders rolled under his feet. Reaching the
farther bank, he found the rocky wall rising fifteen
feet above his head. He swung himself up by the
roots of a stunted fir that clung to the bank by
gnarled and contorted talons, and swarmed up the
trunk till he reached the boughs. Below, the
torrent foamed in the sun, burdening the air with
a hoarse swirl of sound. Tristan’s head came level
with the summit of the wall. Craning his neck
and keeping well within the bosom of the tree, he
peered over into the space beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without lay the wild woods, the torrent, and
the unknown; within all the sumptuous colour of
the south seemed engirdled by that circle of
grey stone. Smooth lawns, emerald bright,
gleamed betwixt massed banks of flowers.
Fragrant herbs perfumed the air. Pomegranates
grew there hung thick with fruit, oleanders with
red coronets burned beside the slim and dusky
cypresses. Apricots gleamed from lush eaves of
green, and vines with their purple clusters were
growing about the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as Tristan watched he saw colour moving
within a tunnel of close-clipped box, the gleam of
a blue kirtle, the glimmer of golden hair. He
hung in the tree and waited, for there was no sound
in his ears save the roaring of the stream. Anon,
the figure came out from the box thicket into the
sun, where a bed of balsams coloured the grass.
Tristan well-nigh lost his hold of the tree, for it
was Rosamunde herself who walked in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan coloured like a great boy at the very
sight of her face. It was months since he had
looked on it, and his stout heart hurried. How
fair she was, how tall and slender! The very
flowers seemed graceless at her feet! Tristan felt
the old strange awe of her rise up within his heart.
With the stars and the moon she was throned
above the world, and as she walked the lawns
with her stately air he had more fear of her than
of twenty Ogiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan watched her, wondered what thoughts
were in her heart. There was a slight drooping
of the queenly head, a limpness of the hands as
they shone white against her blue kirtle. Would
she be glad of the liberty he brought to her, to
lay with his sword and shield before her feet?
Cared she for Jocelyn, with his sleek, shaven
face? God, no; such fawning apes were fit but
for Lilias and Agravale, that city of sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, turning suddenly from the sunlit
lawn before him, passed down a terrace-way built
above an offshoot of the stream, where oleanders
grew in great stone jars. Water plashed beneath
on ferns and moss-green stones. Tristan, while
her back was turned, swung along a bough and
straddled the wall. It was smooth on the inner
face, giving no foothold, no vantage to the fingers.
Tristan jumped for it, landed in a bed of pinks,
rolled over, and scrambled up with earthy hands.
The soft loam and the plants had deadened his
fall. He crossed a stretch of grass, rounded a
clump of bays, found Rosamunde leaning on
the balustrade of a little bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name was mouthed in a half-credulous
whisper, as she turned on him, sudden colour
surging to her cheeks. She grew pale again, yet
her eyes were full of a strange brightness, her
face turned slightly heavenwards, with the red lips
parted above the strong white chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was redder than Rosamunde. Her
beauty silenced him, and he could gaze, nothing
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, I thought you dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead, God be thanked, no,” he said, going
on his knees as one who remembered tales of
courtesy. “Ah, Madame Rosamunde, I have kept
my faith. I have searched and found you.
Behold, I bring liberty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood back as the man did her homage
stiffly, yet with a rugged dignity that showed his
temper. There was vast earnestness upon Rosamunde’s
face. The baser passions of the world
had hemmed her in these many months, and dread
of their animal strength had made her eye all men
askance. Even Tristan was not trusted yet. A
woman jealous of her womanhood, she conned his
face as though to read his humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, I thought you dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as though she parleyed with him that
she might judge him the more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, am I dust, madame?” he answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How came you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan felt some cloud between him and her
eyes. Her grave and watchful temper puzzled
him, nor had he foreshadowed such cold gratitude
as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame Rosamunde,” he said, “Samson the
Heretic saved me from death; you shall hear the
tale anon, if you should wish for it. My life was
yours, and Columbe my sister’s. I had vowed
faith to you both, and so came to Agravale. The
Bishop’s captain hired my sword. Yet though
I served him with a traitorous heart, I won no
word of you till yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went nearer to him again, still gazing on
his face, and her eyes were on Tristan’s, nor did
he waver. So cold did she seem that he felt great
shame growing within his heart, for it flashed on
him in a moment that she despised this faith of
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, very solemnly, as though
plotting to challenge his honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose up and faced her with folded arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” and there was more passion in her
voice, “I have borne much, suffered many things
from the evil men have conceived against my soul.
Ah, God! I have lived in hell these many weeks.
I am a woman, and I am alone. By your
manhood, swear to me you will not trick my
trust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frowned a little and his mouth hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I not proved my faith?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have dared much. Tell me, have I failed
you ever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Tristan, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mistrust me, I can return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was so deep a bitterness in his strong
voice that she read his honour, and went near to
him with her face upturned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, I am half ashamed,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, madame, I shall never shame you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was breathing deeply, and she stooped
of a sudden and kissed him on the lips. A red
wave rushed over Tristan’s face. He stood stiff
as a rock, with her hands upon his shoulders,
looked in her eyes, and moved not a muscle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I take your gratitude and ask no
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As there is honour in me, I will serve you,
and ask no return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, with an uprushing of
faith, “I can trust at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God guard us both, madame,” he said very
simply. “For your sake, I have been tempted,
yet my heart is clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood back from him, and covered her eyes
for a moment with her arm. At the very gesture
a silver circlet upon her wrist caught Tristan’s
eye, a coiled snake of tarnished silver, curiously
wrought, with emeralds for eyes. Tristan thrust
out a hand towards Rosamunde with a strange
cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That bracelet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared in his face, and twisted the thing
from off her wrist. Tristan snatched at the circlet
of silver, handled it almost with the greed of a
miser gloating over some splendid gem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whence had you this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words came sharp and savage as the blows
of an armourer’s hammer upon steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak,” he said, with a strong gesture of the
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bracelet I found in a room they gave
me here,” she said, “hid in a chest with other
stuffs. What is it to you, Tristan, that you pull
so wry a face?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, with great passion in his
eyes, “I saw this last upon my sister’s arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, then, Ogier spoke the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde’s expression changed, like one who
hears the stealthy step of an enemy on the grass.
Her eyes dilated, her face paled. She thrust out
a hand and pointed Tristan to a thicket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pandart comes. Quick, hide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Pandart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My jailer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then God deliver him,” said Tristan, with his
mouth like iron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stout and ungainly being appeared round a
thicket of bay trees, like some stout god Pan footing
it in Arcady. It was the figure of a little man
with a toad-like face, protruding blue eyes, and a
great slit of a mouth. A double chin flapped to
and fro under his ugly but good-tempered countenance,
and his legs were bowed like the staves of
a cask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart, good soul, was a mild man, a man of
milk, who feared the Bishop and Ogier his knight.
Slow of wit, he took life calmly, and was amazed
at nothing so long as he had food. He stopped
short when he saw Tristan standing by the White
Heretic of the Seven Streams, and blinked his
eyes under their penthouses of fat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The salutation that was accorded him hardly
tallied with the good man’s temper. Waddling
over the grass like a fat and amiable dog, he was
taken of a sudden by the throat and hurled flat
upon his back. A whirlwind seemed to fill the
place. Above him lowered a pale, set face, while
a sword’s point rested over his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart, shrewdly scared and beaten for breath,
lay and blinked at the man who held the sword.
His shoulder had been disjointed in the fall, his
arm lying twisted under his body; yet, despite the
pain of it, he dared not stir, seeing that the bare
steel weighed on his ribs. The silver circlet was
thrust into his face. Pandart’s eyes seemed bewitched
by the thing, while Tristan watched him
as a dog watches a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he forced the truth from the man concerning
Columbe, whom he had sought from over
the sea. Under the point of Tristan’s sword,
Pandart told what had passed in the hermitage,
Columbe’s coming and her shaming there, and,
last, how she had died by Ogier’s hand, to make
way for Rosamunde of the Seven Streams. It
was a grim tale for a brother’s ears, but Tristan
heard it to the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was that Rosamunde, who watched
him, saw his face become as the face of a devil.
He reared up his sword over Pandart’s carcass,
heeding not his whimpering nor his outstretched
hand. Rosamunde, waking as from a dream,
sprang forward and seized on Tristan’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slay him not,” she said. “Shall the man
suffer for the master’s sin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan flashed round on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betwixt them they have slain my sister,”
he cried. “Am I a woman to snivel and
forgive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without flinching, she met the anger in
his eyes, keeping her hold upon his powerful
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has not Ogier perished at your hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God did deliver him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not against this old man can you lift your
sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart had slipped aside from under Tristan’s
feet. He struggled to his knees and knelt there
in the grass, his right arm hanging helpless from
the shoulder. Tristan, looking at the grey head
and the wrinkled face, relented somewhat, remembering
his own sire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall judge,” he said to Rosamunde,
giving her the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took it and set the point upon the
grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak with him yet further,” she said. “Have
pity on his grey hairs, for the old man has been
kind to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left them there together, while Pandart
rose up from the grass and stood before Tristan,
holding his maimed arm at the elbow. The anger
was melting out of Tristan’s heart, and grief
gathered in him as he thought of Columbe’s
golden head lying tarnished under the sods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show me the grave,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart, wincing as he walked, led Tristan
amid the flowers and fruit trees to where a great
cedar stood, and a low green mound received
the sunlight streaming through the boughs. Tall
cypresses were crowded near, like mutes standing
about a grave, while the great cedar’s vaulted
gloom made the place solemn as a shrine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Tristan had looked long on the green
mound in silence, he questioned Pandart further,
and received the truth. Ogier had slain Columbe
at the Bishop’s bidding, even to make room for
Rosamunde, whom they had brought from Agravale.
They had buried Columbe there under the
light of the moon, with the red rose of death
over her heart. Tristan said hardly a word, but
suffered Pandart to pass back to the house, where
his dame, a thin woman with a querulous face,
cringed and waited for him behind the door.
Pandart went in and bade her swathe his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Rosamunde walked alone on the
terrace-way where the oleanders bloomed in their
stone jars. She was a strange woman, this Lady
of the Seven Streams, devout yet passionate,
gracious yet ever too enamoured of her pride.
Perverse and incomprehensible, half shrew, half
saint, beautiful even in her perversity, she was
destined to pain those who gave her love. Jealous
of her liberty, she would go shackled by a whim,
provided the whim was of her own forging.
Tristan she had believed dead these many months,
and Tristan loved her. As a woman, she knew
that well. Yet she had ordained it in her heart
that Tristan’s love was mere summer madness, a
boy’s love, beneath her pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Columbe his sister, then, was dead. Of the
white-faced child from Purple Isle Rosamunde had
had no knowledge. She had often gazed at the
fresh-tufted mound under the cedar, but Pandart
had kept silence and betrayed nothing. She felt
a woman’s pity for this blue-eyed child reft from
her home, bruised by the passions of a ruffian
crew, done to death in this wild hermitage. The
truth revealed to her her own real peril and the
grim depths of Jocelyn’s perfidy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anon, she left the terrace and passed towards
the cedar. Infinite thought dwelt in her large
eyes, a beautiful wistfulness upon her mouth.
Coming to the cypresses, she stood to listen. A
sound, deep and significant, quickened the look
of pity on her face. She stood open-mouthed,
listening to the sound of a strong man weeping.
There was an almost godly pathos in those tears.
The truth thrilled Rosamunde to the core of her
red heart, made her lips quiver, her eyes grow
hot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan weeping! This great warm-hearted
creature broken down by the touch of death!
She listened with tingling ears, half ashamed of
prying upon such sorrow, for the sound awed
her utterly, dethroned the pride from out her soul.
All the deep instincts of her womanhood awoke,
tremulous and tender, poignant with another’s
pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By sudden impulse she pushed past the cypresses,
stood under the huge shadows of the
cedar. Tristan was lying full length upon the
grave, his face hidden within his arms. She saw
his shoulders rise and fall, and he still had the
silver circlet gripped in his right hand. Rosamunde
stood impotent, hesitating to violate such
grief as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the man grew calmer, and the passion
seemed to pass like a storm over the sea.
Perhaps some spirit voice stilled the deep waters,
the cry of the Christ to foaming Galilee. Rosamunde,
moving over the grass, stooped, touched
Tristan’s shoulder with her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He twisted round like one smitten with a hot
iron, and there was a shadow as of anger on his
face. It was shame to a strong man such as
Tristan to be caught with tears upon his cheeks.
He rose up and knelt beside the grave, propping
himself upon one arm. Rosamunde’s hand was
still upon his shoulder; his other arm he held
before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said sullenly, “must you stare
upon my weakness thus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, may I not share your sorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knelt down suddenly at his side, even
like a mother, and drew the arm from before his
face. He did not resist her, though he frowned
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you have been noble towards me
in your faith,” she said; “may I not show a
woman’s gratitude? Is there shame in receiving
this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked in her eyes, but did not look for
long, for there was still some bitterness within his
heart. Was it not for Rosamunde that Columbe
his sister had been done to death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said, speaking slowly her
name, “the wounded bear must lick his
wounds and growl out his fury in some lonely
den.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she pleaded, “you grudge my gratitude
to you for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I cannot parcel out my grief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of your vengeance—can I not share in
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lash of the tongue suited to rouse
such a man as Tristan. The speech was quick
and swiftly sped. Tristan sprang from the grass
like one who heard a faint voice calling from
the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vengeance—God hear me—yes!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood there above Rosamunde and the
grave, breathing heavily, the muscles showing in
his powerful neck, his face transfigured for the
moment. Taking the snake of silver, he wound
it about his wrist, made a great vow with his
hands uplifted to high Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never shall this poor relic leave this arm,”
he said, “till it has hurled down Agravale into
the dust.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Evening descended, and the green valley was full
of golden light. Afar on the hills the great trees
dreamed, dome on dome, touching the transient
scarlet of the west. Ilex and cedar stood like
sombre giants in a shimmering sea. The eastern
slopes gleamed in the sun, a cataract of leaves
plunging into gloom. The forest was full of
shadows and mysterious streams of gold, and a
great silence shrouded the wilderness save for the
restless thunder of the stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had gone to bring the horses to a
thicket on the western bank near the island. Moreover,
he had played the Samaritan to Pandart, had
twisted the disjointed head of the bone back into
the socket, even as he had learnt the trick from
a smith in Purple Isle. With the calm of the
declining day, some measure of peace had fallen
upon Tristan’s soul. He was a sanguine being,
brave in a rallying, quick to recover heart.
Columbe was dead, and he had wept for her.
Vengeance was to be thenceforth his life’s purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Rosamunde? Tristan had discovered
comfort in her presence there, for love takes beauty
as a balm into its breast. He had great hopes and
passionate prophecies in his heart. Rosamunde
had knelt by him; her hand had touched his hand.
God, how his lips still thrilled to the magic of her
kiss! And those eyes, were they not wonderful,
passing the burnished stars in the dark firmament?
There was great awe of her in Tristan’s
heart, great joy in her rich beauty, faith to defend
her against man and beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he came from watering his horses at the
stream, he heard the sound of a woman singing,
for Rosamunde walked in the garden amid the
vines and pomegranates, chanting some sorrowful
legend of lost love. Pandart had shown Tristan
a rough bridge across the stream, where giant
boulders had been set as stepping-stones betwixt
the western grassland and the island. There was
a narrow postern giving entry through the wall.
Tristan stood at the gate and listened. Above the
thunder of the foaming stream the rich voice
clambered, strong and clear. Even the great
golden vault of heaven seemed full of the echoes
of that passionate song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Rosamunde seated on the terrace-way
where the oleanders bloomed. Under the
stone bridge the water foamed and bubbled, the
ferns and moss green and brilliant above the foam.
About her rose the knolls of the gold-fruited trees.
Farther, the forests climbed into the glory of the
heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ceased singing as Tristan came to her, put
the lute aside, made room for him on the long
bench of stone. There was a tinge of petulance on
her red mouth, the pathetic perverseness of a heart
that loved not by the will of circumstance. Rosamunde
was as a woman deceived by dreams. She
desired the moon in the person of a man, and since
fate bowed not to her desire, she turned her back
in anger upon the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Tristan she felt great pity, honest gratitude,
but the memory of Samson blinded her to
deeper imaginings. That Tristan loved her, being
a woman, she knew full well. And yet she feared
him for this very love, stiffened her perverseness
against his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan sat on the stone seat and looked at her
with his honest eyes. To Rosamunde there was
a love therein, a love that she could not fathom.
The look troubled her, seeing that she had no
echo in her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, I have words for you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say on,” he answered her, his eyes fixed
solemnly upon her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had served her well, better than man
had ever served before. Yet he had raised no
such image in her heart as Samson the Heretic
had built therein. To Rosamunde, Tristan was
still but a generous boy; for she had not comprehended
the godlier manhood enshrined behind his
youth. He was silent, slow of speech, ignorant
in the subtler sense; and feeling herself the wiser
of the twain, she did not hesitate to air her
wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will sail for Purple Isle?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flashed a keen look at her, and his face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Purple Isle is far from me as yet,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you, then?” she asked. “Believe
me, Tristan, I will not hinder you. We
must part, both of us. There are other claims
upon my soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, Jocelyn still lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will deal with him—what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer Rosamunde for a moment.
His eyes were troubled, and he looked like one
whose thoughts were buffeted by a strong wind.
Above them the zenith mellowed to a deeper gold,
and they had the noise of waters in their ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said at last, “what would
you with me? Am I not pledged to guard your
honour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” she said, drooping her lashes, “I will
give you your liberty, Tristan, soon enough. I
shall not clog your years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, what purpose have you in your
heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was almost a strain of fierceness in his
voice, the tone of a man tortured by suspense.
Rosamunde looked at him, saw love upon his face,
like a sunset streaming through a cloud. She
pitied him for a moment, but hardened her heart
the more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, I am weary of the world,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weary, madame, when you are free?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is free in life? I am fearful of the ruffian
passions of the world, of lusts and terrors, ay, even
of love itself. Life seethes with turbulence and
the great throes of wrath. I would be at peace. I
would give myself to God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rose up suddenly, and began to stride
to and fro before her. He loved Rosamunde,
knew it in that moment with all the strongest fibres
of his heart. He had hoped too much, trusted too
much to the power of his own faith. He turned
and faced her there, calm outwardly, miserable
within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must this thing be?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was such deep wistfulness in those words
of his that she bent her head and would not look
into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “I pray you plead no
further with my heart. I shall turn nun; there is
the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will, madame,” he answered; “ ’tis
not for me to parley with your soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood motionless with head thrown back,
his eyes gazing upon the darkening windows of
the east. The sound of the running waters surged
in his ears; the colours and odours of the place
seemed to faint into the night. As for Rosamunde,
she moved never a muscle. The man’s
great faith seemed to fill her with a gradual
shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said at last, “have I not said
that I am weary of the world, its passions and its
inconstant smiles? Guard me for one short week,
and I will ask no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was that inexplicable perversity in her
heart that at certain moments makes a woman
traitorous to her own desires. Rosamunde, passionate
pessimist, beckoned her own fate on with
a bitterness that Tristan could not fathom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” she said. “In the province of the
Seven Streams there stands the great convent of
Holy Guard, set on a headland above the sea.
’Tis many leagues south of Joyous Vale, by the
great river that parts our province from Duchess
Lilias’s lands. The Papists have spared the place,
since Samson was never there. Thither, Tristan,
shall you take me. I will turn nun, and take the
veil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan watched her, listening like a man to the
reading of his own doom. Rosamunde did not
look at him. Her fair head was bowed down over
her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since this is your desire,” he said to her, “I
am content to see you bulwarked from the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you will take me to Holy Guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, have I not promised?”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was astir early with the coming of the
day. He passed over the stream, saddled and
bridled the horses for the morning’s sally. The
grass was drenched with dew; the woods towered
heavenwards with a thousand golden peaks, while
in the valley the river echoed back the light, chanting
sonorously as it slid under the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was very solemn about the eyes that
morning. He looked like a man who took little
joy in life, but worked that he might ease his heart.
He watched the sun climb over the leafy hills, saw
the clouds tread the heavens, heard the thunder
of the stream. There was life in the day and wild
love in the woods. Yet from this world of passion
and delight he was an exile; nay, rather, a pilgrim
therein fettered by a heavy vow. Strong man, he
was to bear the Grail of Love through all these
wilds, yet might never look thereon, nor quench
his thirst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed back into the garden with dead
Ogier’s sword under his arm. Columbe’s grave
lay steeped in sunlight, a-glitter with the dew upon
the grass. Tristan took Ogier’s sword, set it
upright in the midst of the grave, knelt down and
prayed there, his face bowed within his folded
arms. He swore that Ogier’s sword should rust
in the grass till Jocelyn should rest in his spilt
blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tristan knelt there, Rosamunde came out
to him from Pandart’s house. She was cloaked
in green for riding, the crimson-lined hood turned
back upon her shoulders. Her golden head
gleamed bright as yellow gillyflower in the sun,
yet her looks were distraught and somewhat sullen.
Tristan rose to meet her. They kept their distance,
seemed fearful of looking in each other’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you are ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have saddled the horses,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She read the heroism in his heart, the bitterness
of the faith she compelled from him. The truth
troubled her, since it shamed her also; for Tristan
had grief enough, as she knew well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pandart has prepared us food,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pandart must speak with me. See yonder
sword, Rosamunde; the blade must bide there till
I come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose is the sword?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead Ogier’s,” he answered her, frowning
and clenching his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart came out to them from the house, and
cringed to Tristan like a beaten hound. He had
a leather wallet under his arm, a water-flask in
his hand. Tristan took him by the shoulder,
thrust him towards the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See yonder sword?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, sir, I see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis dead Ogier’s sword. Pluck it thence,
and the dead shall rise. Mark me, I return again
to take that blood relic from my sister’s grave.
Touch yonder sword, and by heaven and hell, you
shall pay the price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not meddle,” said Pandart, with his mouth
agape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Rosamunde made no more tarrying.
They crossed the stream, Pandart following
with their meagre baggage. Tristan strapped
the wallet and water-flask to his saddle, and
lifted Rosamunde to Ogier’s horse. Then they
took leave of Pandart and the island in the
stream, and riding northwards, plunged into the
woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day Tristan strove and struggled with
his youth, his great heart beating fast and loud
under his steel hauberk. Love was at his side,
robed in crimson and green; her hair blinded him
more than the noon brightness of the sun. As for
her eyes, he dared not look therein, lest they should
tempt him to deceive his honour. Silence bewitched
the pair as though they were half fearful of each
other’s thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan spoke little, keeping his distance, as
though mistrusting his own tongue. As for Rosamunde,
the same passionate perversity possessed
her heart, and though she pitied Tristan, she pitied
him silently and from afar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first night they lodged them in a beech
wood where dead leaves spread a dry carpet under
the boughs. Tristan made a bed of leaves at the
foot of a great tree. He spread a cloak and saddle-cloth
for Rosamunde’s comfort, made as though
to leave her alone in the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said suddenly, looking slantwise
at his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have given me your cloak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mere rag, Rosamunde; ’twill keep the cold
from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not need it,” he said to her, “for I
shall not sleep to-night. I keep watch and guard
you. Have no fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed, hung her head, sat down at the
foot of the tree. The man’s unselfish faith shamed
her more and more. Perhaps, in her perversity,
she strove to love him the less for the rough
simplicity of his good faith. His very patience
hardened her discontent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, with a last look, left her there, and
wandered away into the woods. A full moon
climbed in the east, and the wide land was smitten
with her mystery. The valleys were as lakes of
glimmering mist, the hills like icy pinnacles gleaming
towards the stars. The forest glades were
white under the moon; the trees, tall, sculptured
pyramids, their trunks as of ebony inlaid with pearl
wherever the moonlight splashed the bark. The
silence of the wilderness was as the silence of a
windless sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan wandered in the woods, his heart full
of the strange, sad beauty of that summer night.
The stars spoke of Rosamunde; the trees had her
name unuttered on their lips. What was this
woman that she should bring such bitterness into
his life? Were there not others in the world as
fair as she, with lips as red and eyes as magical?
Strangeness; mystery. She was one with the moon,
a goddess shrined in the gloom of forests dim.
White and immaculate, beautifully strange, she
was as an elf-child fated to doom men to despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan passed back, found her asleep under the
tree. He stood beside her, gazed on the sleeping
face. There was silent faith in that slumber;
trust in the man who guarded her honour. The
moonlight streamed on the upturned face, shining
like ivory amid the gleam of her hair. How white
her throat was, how her bosom rose and fell with
the long pale hands folded thereon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden warmth flooded Tristan’s heart, and
youth cried in him like a desirous wind. Should
this beauty be mured in stone, this red rose be
hid by convent trees? Was she not flesh and
blood, born to love and to be loved in turn—and
what was life but love and desire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crept near on his knees, hung over her
breathlessly, gazing on her face. God, but to
wake her with one long kiss, to feel those white
arms steal round his neck! They were alone, the
two of them, under the stars. For many minutes
Tristan hung there like a man tottering on a crag
betwixt sea and sky. Passion whimpered in him;
his heart smote fast. Yet even as he crouched
over Rosamunde asleep, some dream or vision
seemed to trouble her soul. Her hands stirred,
her lids quivered, her breath came fast betwixt
her lips. A shadow as of pain passed over the
moonlit face. Tristan, motionless, heard her utter
a low cry, saw tears gleaming upon her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pity, the strong tenderness of his nobler self,
rushed back into the deeps as a wave from a cliff.
The black thoughts flew from his heart like bats
frightened by the light of the sun. Great shame
seized on Tristan; he fell down at the foot of a
tree and prayed.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth day towards evening Tristan and Rosamunde
saw the sea, a wild streak of troubled gold
under the kindling cressets of the west. Beneath
them lay a valley full of tangled scrub and wind-worn
trees. Westwards rose a great rock thrusting
its huge black bastions out into the sea. Upon
this rock rose the towers and pinnacles of Holy
Guard, smitten with gold, wrapped in mysterious
vapour. Into the east stretched a wilderness of
woods, dim and desolate, welcoming the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Rosamunde rode out from the
woods towards the sea, while in the west the sun
sank into a bank of burning clouds. The trees
were wondrous green in the slant light; the whole
world seemed bathed in strange ethereal glory.
Holy Guard upon its headland stood like black
marble above the far glimmerings of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan le Sauvage rode with his eyes fixed on
the burning clouds. Rosamunde was watching
him with strange unrest. Since that first night in
the woods he had held aloof from her, had spoken
little, had harnessed himself with an iron pride.
Yet at times, when his eyes had unwillingly met
hers, she had seen the sudden gleam therein of a
strong desire. She had watched the dusky colour
rise on Tristan’s sunburnt face, the deep-drawn
breaths that ebbed and flowed under the man’s
hauberk. Though his mouth was as granite,
though he hid his heart from her, she knew full
well that he loved her to the death. The fine
temper of his faith had humiliated and even
angered her. Though his despair deified her
vanity with heroic silence, the man’s courage made
her miserable from sheer sympathy and shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed a small stream and came to a
sandy region where stunted myrtles clambered over
the rocks, and tamarisk, tipped as with flame,
waved in the wind. Storm-buffeted and dishevelled
pines stood thicketed upon the hillocks. The place
was sombre and very desolate, silent save for the
low piping of the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Rosamunde nor Tristan had spoken
since they left the woods and sighted Holy Guard.
The man pointed suddenly with his hand towards
the cliffs, the light of the setting sun streaming
upon his white and solemn face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder is Holy Guard,” he said to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a species of defiance in the cry, as
though the man’s soul challenged fate. His
heart’s cords were wrung in the cause of honour.
Rosamunde quailed inwardly like one ashamed,
her lips quivered, her eyes for the moment were in
peril of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder is Holy Guard,” she echoed in an
undertone. “There I may escape the world and
be at peace. Tristan, you have served me well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, madame,” he said, with increasing bitterness,
“I have done my duty. Remember me, I
pray you, in your prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not forget,” she answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” he said, with some grim emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A narrow causeway curled upwards towards
the towers upon the rock. The sea had sunk behind
the cliffs; the sky faded to a less passionate
colour. Rosamunde’s eyes were on the walls of
Holy Guard, and she seemed lost in musings as
they rode side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said suddenly, as they neared
the sea, “think not hardly of me; rather pity me
in your heart. Strife and unrest are everywhere.
It is better to escape the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, perhaps,” he said, with his eyes upon
the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget that there is such a woman as Rosamunde,”
she said. “In Holy Guard I shall strive
to forget the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can forget?” he muttered. “While life
lasts, memories live on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to the causeway where the track
wound like a black snake towards the golden
heights. Not a sound was there save the distant
surging of the sea. The distorted trees thrust out
their hands, and seemed to cry <span class='it'>Vale</span> to the two
upon the road. At the foot of the causeway, Tristan
turned his horse. He took one long look at
Rosamunde, then gazed beyond her into the hurrying
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God give you peace, madame,” he said, with
deep vibrations in his powerful voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you will not leave me yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he cried, with sudden great bitterness,
“is it so easy to say farewell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s strong despair swept over her like
a wind. She sat mute and motionless upon her
horse, gazing at him helplessly like one half dazed.
On the cliff Holy Guard beckoned with the great
cross above its topmost pinnacle. Rosamunde
shivered, strove with herself, was perverse as of
yore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I that you should crave for me?”
she said. “I have but little beauty, and am growing
old. Leave me, Tristan; forget and forgive.
I have no heart to surrender to the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was white to the lips as he stiffened his
manhood to meet the wrench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde, I would have loved you well,”
he said. “No matter. God cherish you, and give
you peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, leaning towards him from
the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a hoarse cry, covered his face with his
hand, would not look at her despite her pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” he said, “say no more to me. It
is enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smote his horse with the spurs, wheeled from
her, passed by without a look. His face was as
the face of a man who rode to meet his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan!” she cried to him, but he would not
hear her. She saw him plunge to a gallop, saw the
shield betwixt his shoulders dwindle into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan!” she cried again, with sudden loneliness
seizing on her heart. “Tristan, come back to
me! Tristan, Tristan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry was vain, for he would not hear her,
deeming her pity more grievous than her scorn.
Despair spurred him on; the black night called.
Rosamunde watched him vanish into the increasing
gloom, while on the cliffs Holy Guard stood
like the great gate of death.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rode through the woods from Holy Guard
that autumntide fierce of heart and grim of face.
He held northwards for Tor’s Tower by the rugged
coast that closed the western sea, glad of his own
savage strength and the rude wilderness that
suited his temper. The elemental fiercenesses of
life had waxed within him, and action came as a
balm to his raw and rebellious spirit. With Rosamunde
gone from the heavens like the chastening
moon, primitive darkness had fallen around. The
glimmering stars of chivalry were faint above.
The wild beasts seemed akin to Tristan; he fought
and slew, was even as they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this wise, gaunt and wind-tanned, with rusty
hauberk and unshaven chin, he came after many
days to Tor’s Tower, where Samson had gathered
the folk of the Seven Streams. It was a wintry
evening, grey and desolate, with clouds racing in
the heavens and the sea rushing towards the shore.
In the woods a shower of leaves were falling, dancing
and flickering to the piping of the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Tor’s Tower the cry went up from the rude
camp in the meadows to the grey walls upon the
cliff: “Tristan has come, Tristan le Sauvage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Savage indeed seemed the wanderer who met
the greetings of these iron men, took their rough
hand-grips and the waving of their steel. Unshaven,
sullen, and fierce of eye, with his black
hair tangled by the wind and rain, he was no
gay pilgrim on his great raw-boned horse. Tristan
climbed the causeway with his face towards the sea,
and dismounted before the castle gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson stood there to greet him with his hands
outstretched, a warm light on his powerful face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome, brother, out of the south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood and looked into each other’s eyes
like men to whom silence meant more than words.
Tristan’s mood could be deciphered from his face,
with its pursed up mouth and sullen eyes. Samson
read the truth thereon, how much Tristan had left
in the Southern Marches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed together into the tower, and climbing
the stairs, looked out over the battlements
towards the sea. Below them stretched the
marshes and the sandy shore, and in the east the
woods waved their reddened banners against the
night. Samson leant against the parapet and
watched Tristan as he stood beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have failed, brother?” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger man’s face seemed to grow the
more sullen. Though he had lost the buoyant
zest of youth, he had gained more of the grim
purpose of manhood. It was the face of a fanatic
that Samson watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have failed,” he said, simply enough,
“failed and yet won, as fate did order it. The
Lady Rosamunde I rescued out of Jocelyn’s hands,
and set her in Holy Guard by the sea, whither I
rode with her at her command.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Guard, brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde’s heart was towards the place.
What could my ugly face make of love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that wind-swept tower Tristan told Samson
of his wanderings in the south. He recounted
how he had joined the Bishop’s men and sojourned
in Agravale two months or more. He told how
he had ridden with Jocelyn and Ogier to the madhouse
in the mere, how he had slain Ogier, and
found Rosamunde and his sister’s grave. Lastly,
he confessed to Rosamunde’s weariness of the
world, and told how he had left her in Holy Guard
by the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had ended, Samson spoke to him,
looking tenderly on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are with us yet, brother, despite the
past?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sword is yours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Till we have slain Jocelyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And hurled down Agravale into the dust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed down from the tower, for the wind
was keen and the night was gathering in the east.
Samson had news upon his tongue, and as they
paced the court together, he told Tristan of all that
had passed since he had wandered in the south.
A champion had risen up to preserve the province
of the Seven Streams and to fling a broad shield
over the broken land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche, Duchess of the Northern Wilds, had
fallen in the past under the spell of Samson’s
preaching, and with her nobles she had received
the heresy. That same summer the noise of the
dark deeds done in the province of the Seven
Streams had come to her over the southern borders.
Being a woman of heroic temper, she had
risen in wrath over the burning of Ronan’s town
and the slaughter Jocelyn’s men had made in the
land. She had summoned her liegemen to her
in her city by the northern sea, and had put
before them the wrongs of the Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” quoth she to her knights and freemen,
“Pope or no Pope, let us end this butchery. Since
our lord the King cannot keep peace in his provinces,
by our Lord Christ in heaven, I, Blanche
the Duchess, will stay the strong from murdering
the weak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the King who ruled those lands was but
the creature of a lawless court, the tool of fair
women, the puppet of the priests. His great
vassals flouted him when they would, and made
war on each other like petty kings, filling the
land with war and turmoil. Hence Blanche that
autumntide had crossed her borders, and daring
her suzerain to hinder her, had marched with her
men for the Seven Streams. Of all this Samson
told Tristan as they paced the court under the
darkening sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus early that winter, at Samson’s desire,
Tristan rode out with a hundred spears to bring
the Duchess Blanche to Tor’s Tower by the sea.
It was gusty weather, with the grey sky smitten
through with stormy light and the woods scattering
their last largesse of gold to the wind. Tristan
rode over the moors with his hundred men, and
about noon on the second day saw the lances of
the Duchess’s men pricking along a sandy track
that wound amid knolls of heather towards the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan, having sent forward a herald, watched
their oncoming from the crest of a low hill. A
woman rode in the near van, mounted on a great
white horse, its harness of scarlet leather bossed
with gold. She was clad in green, and carried a
light spear with a silver pennon tongueing from
its throat. Tristan doubted not that she was the
Duchess, the most splendid woman of her age,
who had saved her duchy by her own good
courage from the greedy onslaughts of many
neighbouring lords. She had built up a strong
power in the north, and her people worshipped
her almost as a saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rode down and met the Duchess at the
head of her men. She was a big woman, whose
jet black hair was thickly streaked with silvery
strands. Her face was as fresh as a young girl’s,
with but few wrinkles about the eyes that beamed
and flashed over the world. From her stately
throat to her large white hands, she was full of
rich and vigorous life. No longer young, she had
kept her beauty, even as good fruit mellows under
the autumn sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan bent the knee to her without constraint,
for from the first glance he had taken her measure,
and marked the queenliness that all true men
honoured. She sat on her white horse and looked
him over as he stood in the road with his drawn
sword set point downwards in the sand. As for
Tristan, he felt that the woman’s eyes searched
and considered his whole heart, and that honour
stood for fame before her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, sir, you are from Tor’s Tower?” she said
to him, smiling down. “My war-wolves follow me
to give Samson succour. Think you we can make
the place by night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is some ten leagues to Tor’s Tower,”
Tristan answered her, “and too much marching
will tire your men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it be on the morrow, then,” she said; “he
is in no need of us for a day, I trow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bade Tristan mount and ride at her side,
while the long spears bristled over the sandy heath,
and the banner of the Bleeding Cross flapped in
the wind. Behind them over the dusky slopes
came the rough warriors of the north, bronzed,
bearded men, big of bone and burly of limb.
Their axes hung at their saddle bows, their long
shields blinked towards the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess questioned Tristan as he rode at
her side concerning Samson’s power and the state
of the Seven Streams. There were many strong
places that had been garrisoned by the Bishop’s
men, such as Sanguelac and Merdin and Marvail
by the fords of the Lorient. Tristan told her all
he knew as to Jocelyn’s garrisons and Samson’s
fortune. He discovered that the Duchess was
well versed in war, that she had a stout heart
and a generous instinct. She recalled to him
Rosamunde whom he had left in Holy
Guard, save that she was older by some fifteen
years, and had more strength and sureness of
courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day Tristan rode at her side, under the
ken of her fearless eyes. She was not a woman
a true man could dissemble with, for she possessed
that strange charm that forbade reserve, that
natural sincerity that commanded trust. Before
many hours had passed Tristan’s tongue was running
briskly as for some friend. His strong face
and his grim manner pleased the woman, for she
was one who hated a perfumed sprig, and could
not suffer a honeyed tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, gracious lady that she was, she soon had
Tristan at her service. The man told her much
of his life, how he had sailed in search of his sister,
and fallen in with the heretics of the Seven
Streams. He told her also of his sojourn in the
south, how he had found his sister’s grave and
had sworn vengeance over it against Jocelyn of
Agravale. But of Rosamunde of Ronan’s town
he said but little, for he would not speak of that
which concerned his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came that night to a lonely tower on the
hills, and lodged there until the morning. Blanche
had gathered that Tristan was no knight, but a
mere soldier of circumstance, whose honest sword
was of more worth than an ancient title. Therefore
she called him before her that same evening
and gave him knighthood at her hands. On the
morrow they marched on towards the sea, and saw
Tor’s Tower rise on its rocky height.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In Agravale there was much blowing of trumpets,
much burnishing of arms. The women of the
city had drawn forth all their gay stuffs, their gold
tissues and fripperies, and much scarlet cloth. The
streets teemed with soldiery gathered from all the
southern baronies, and there were many knights
and nobles in Agravale, the city was full of the
clangour of war. The hostels were full to over-flowing;
each house was a tavern where the wine
ran red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dragon of Heresy had lifted its head once
more out of the dust, and the Papal spies had come
in from the Seven Streams, telling how Samson
was gathering men at Tor’s Tower by the sea.
The tidings had gone out through the Southern
Marches that a second crusade had been ordained
by Heaven against these whelps who blasphemed
the Church. The Pope had despatched his legates
through the duchy, threatening the half-hearted,
blessing the zealous. The Great Father had sent
a sacred banner to Agravale, consecrated to the
cause of the soldiers of God. The Golden Keys
of Heaven flew thereon. Jocelyn, who had been
ordained Bishop of the Crusade, had set the banner
in St. Pelinore’s great church, where the
people might gaze on it and bless God and the
Pope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One winter noon Jocelyn walked in the cloisters
of the abbey of St. Pelinore, with Christopher the
Canon at his side. For an hour they had been
stalking to and fro on the sunny side, with the
carved heads on the corbels grinning one against
another. Jocelyn and the Canon were alone in
the cloisters; more than once a deep chuckle had
seemed to answer the grinning faces above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, we must prevent the ignorant from
blaspheming,” said the Bishop, with a mobile
smile upon his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christopher sniggered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my lord, I have had such troubles myself.
The man must be muzzled, in the cause of
the Church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink the wine and break the pitcher, eh?—such
is the fable. This watch-dog of mine has
come crawling to my feet. I can spurn him anon,
when the truth is out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christopher comforted his superior with the
ready glibness of an underling. He was a man of
the world in the broader sense, had the wit to
ignore unflattering veracity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David, my lord,” he said, “I regard as one of
the most comforting figures in all history. As for
St. Augustine, he enjoyed his youth. ’Tis the
main purpose of a man’s life that tells. Many a
river errs right and left before it finds the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A beneficent doctrine,” quoth the other, with
a glint of the eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart had come through the wilds to Agravale,
and had claimed private audience of the
Bishop that day. The man had waited these three
months in the island hermitage for Jocelyn and his
men—who never came. The Bishop had sojourned
over long in the madhouse in the mere, and had
returned to Agravale without riding to speak with
Rosamunde of the Seven Streams. He had sent
a servant to warn Ogier and Tristan of his return,
but the man had lost himself in the woods, and
had trudged back to Agravale, weary and half-starved.
Each day Jocelyn had thought to hear
Ogier’s deep voice thundering through the court.
Later he had scented treason, and had sent a company
of “spears” to seek out the river hermitage
and to bring Pandart to Agravale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same noon, Jocelyn, returning from the
cloisters of St. Pelinore, found Pandart awaiting
him in the private oratory of the palace. Sable
curtains shut out the daylight. The coloured
mosaics on floor and wall glimmered in the light
of a brazen lamp. Jocelyn barred the door so that
he should be alone with his minion before the little
altar. He seated himself in a carved chair, so that
his face was in the shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, whelp, what have you to tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart prostrated himself, kissed the Bishop’s
shoe, remained kneeling with his clumsy head
bowed down between his shoulders. He dreaded
the truths that were upon his tongue, and it was
only when Jocelyn spurned him that he began to
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ogier is dead, my lord,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn started in his chair, held out a quivering
arm, half in wrath, half in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ogier dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, I found his carcass in the woods; wolves
had mangled it, but I knew the face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose hand did this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan his comrade, who served in the
guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn fingered his smooth round chin. The
natural cunning had crept into his face; he hid his
wrath and dissembled fear, and for the moment
his voice lost its priestly drawl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of the woman Rosamunde?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart grovelled on the stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This same Tristan took her from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye gods, man, did you not fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, this Tristan slew Ogier; he was too
great for me. He would have slain me also had
not the Lady Rosamunde held his hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn remained silent, staring down at Pandart’s
face with its heavy servility and gaping fear.
The man’s words had an import he could not
ignore. Ogier, venal champion of the Church,
was dead, and Rosamunde had escaped with
Tristan into the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more?” he asked anon, his black eyes
gleaming in the light of the lamp, as he saw that
Pandart had not ended his confession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, concerning Columbe, whom Ogier
slew——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn twisted in his chair, for the theme was
bitter, and beyond his dignity. The realisation
of Pandart’s knowledge was no pleasant draught
to the episcopal palate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whelp, what of Columbe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This same Tristan was the girl’s brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had tricked you in Agravale that he might
learn the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn started up and began to stride to and
fro within the narrow compass of the walls. His
hands played with the gold cross at his breast, and
he frowned often, worked his white teeth upon
his full red lip. Pandart knelt before the empty
chair, watching his master with furtive awe. He
had dreaded this truth-telling for many weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, fool, what else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn stood and scowled at Pandart, evil
prophet that he was. It was in his mood to vent
his viciousness upon the man, since he was impotent
to harm those who had baulked his passions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more would my lord know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ape, what followed? Where is this Rosamunde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man Tristan rode with her into the
woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pandart spread his hands; his broad mouth
twitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, I overheard certain words of theirs,”
he said, “while I played eavesdropper in the garden.
The woman spoke of the abbey of Holy
Guard by the sea. She would turn nun. The
man Tristan vowed to guard her thither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Holy Guard, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, so they said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn stood awhile in thought, biting his
nails, staring at the wall. He dismissed Pandart
with certain grim words of warning, scanning his
face narrowly for signs of treachery. When the
man had gone to the scullion quarters, Jocelyn sent
for Nicolon his chamberlain. He told him that
Pandart was a spy and a traitor, sent to search
out Agravale by the heretics of the Seven Streams.
Nicolon understood from the Bishop that he was
to poison Pandart that same night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the day of the gathering of the nobles
of the Southern Marches at the Duchess’s house,
to hear the reading of the Pope’s letter concerning
the conduct of the crusade. Jocelyn went thither
in his robes of state, his pastoral staff borne before
him as he was carried through Agravale on an
open litter with a canopy of purple cloth above.
The canons and priests of Agravale followed in
his train. Behind the clerics came the knights and
retainers of the episcopal palace, with the Pope’s
sacred banner blowing in their midst. The townsfolk
crowded the streets, as the nobles marched
through with full panoply of arms, trumpets blowing,
spears agleam. The women knelt as Jocelyn
was carried by; the men crossed themselves and
bared their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God save the Scourge of the heretics,” ran
the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God save Bishop Jocelyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help the south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With unctuous sanctity upon his face, Jocelyn
was borne through the streets of Agravale. Pomp
and colour played around; the iron men of war
followed hard on his heels. Yet Jocelyn was deaf
to the shouts of the mob, and their superstitious
homage failed for the nonce to fire his vanity. A
woman’s face shone before the churchman’s eyes,
splendid with scorn and unconquerable beauty,
and he licked his lips over his unclean thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the great hall of Dame Lilias’s palace Jocelyn
took his episcopal chair beside the Duchess on the
dais. His clerks and canons thronged the table
below. The benches were crowded with knights
and captains, iron men in hauberk and helm. As
for Lilias, her vanity had climbed to the occasion,
and she had clad herself in a silver hauberk, with
a coronet of steel cushioned on her fair hair. A
dwarf sword was laid across her lap, as she sat
under her canopy, with green lilies blazoned on the
scarlet drapings of her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn, by sudden inspiration, had moulded
the future to his schemes. The plan had come to
him as he was carried through the streets of Agravale.
Had not the Pope made him the Priest of
the Crusade, upon whose prophetic guidance the
barons should rest? While his priests sang a
psalm, their deep voices pealing to the roof, Jocelyn
sat in his splendid robes, facing the nobles. His
countenance was as serene as a little child’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the blessing Jocelyn kissed his
cross, and began to speak to those assembled of
the righteousness of the cause. The Pope’s letter
was read aloud by one of the clerks, wherein the
Pontiff blessed the sons of the Church. Jocelyn
spoke eloquently, with burning words. A full
pardon for all sins would be given to those who
fought in the war. Those who died would be
translated to heaven. The province of the Seven
Streams was to be divided as spoil, and each common
soldier was to have his share.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this holy bribery had been made plain,
Jocelyn diverged to schemes of his own. His
tongue was clever enough to sustain the test, for
it was the very boldness of his hypocrisy that had
ensured men’s trust. He told the knights and
nobles assembled before him how he had been
blessed with a vision concerning the Crusade
against the Seven Streams. The men listened
with superstitious faith, for it was an age when
Christendom had pledged its reason to the
Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brothers,” he said, speaking with a loftiness
that seemed to scorn deceit, “unworthy
though I am of Heaven’s favour, I have been
counselled strangely in a dream. St. Pelinore
stood by me in the midst of the night, even as he
has stood by me in the woods and the mountains.
‘Son,’ he said, ‘the Good God shines on the
Golden Keys. He shall deliver the heretics into
thy hands. First, thou shalt purge me an evil
place, even Holy Guard set above the western sea.
With shame I speak it—the nuns are wantons, its
Abbess a witch. First destroy Holy Guard, then
shall God deliver unto you the province of the
Seven Streams.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s hypocrisy kept pace with his theme,
and none would have suspected the baser passions
that worked beneath. Jocelyn’s eyes flashed as
he spoke, his face was transfigured as by some
heavenly purpose. The vision served him that
night with the assembled barons, for who so
impious that he should deny the saint who had
pointed out Holy Guard as doomed to ruin? It
was agreed among them before they dispersed that
they should march on Holy Guard as St. Pelinore
had said.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Holy Guard towered on its great headland as on
an island, fronting the surges of the sea. The
abbey held the last outjutting of the coast on the
side of the province of the Seven Streams. To the
south, washing the inner surface of the cliff, the
great Gloire came flowing fast, filling the deep
craggy valley from shore to shore, swirling under
the thousand shadows of its ancient trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holy Guard, piled height on height on its lofty
rock, looked over the river mouth where it met
the sea. At low tide the headland was surrounded
with sands, great golden lawns where purple
cloud-shadows raced and played. Beyond were
the white-edged breakers and the silvery azure of
the sea. Myrtles mantled the rock even to where
the spray might fall. From the cliffs and the wild
marshes east of Holy Guard the hills rose up,
sombre with black oak, pine, and yew. Southwards
in clean weather could be seen the peaks
of the great White Mountains that parted the
Crescent from the Christian Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holy Guard—black, desolate, and mysterious—had
received Rosamunde within its walls. The
place was as rugged as the rocks beneath, swept by
the sea wind, bleached by the spray. Its gold
cross on the chapel spire seemed to glitter over a
savage void poised betwixt the clouds and the wild
depths beneath. Chasm and valley plunged to
the waters. The great forests rolled to mimic
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbess Joan was an austere woman and
pitiless, hard of feature as a granite image. She
had suffered much in her early youth, had grown
the more bitter amid cloistered gloom. The nuns
of Holy Guard were grey and rough, shackled by a
discipline that coarsened the soul. For them no
orchards bloomed, no broad valleys were gilded
with easy corn. No music, rich and deep, wreathed
round pillar and under painted vault garlands of
song and of sacred sound. Holy Guard was
dumb, solemn, and saturnine. Its life was as
death, its joy worse than sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Rosamunde, full of a passionate misery,
she had entered its gate dreaming of chants and
the throbbing of bells. She had pictured cloisters
full of golden light, gardens where angels might
have tended the flowers. Her heart was heavy,
yearning for peace, and that infinite calm the
world had not given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holy Guard might have served a demon, by
the fierce and pitiless humour of its heart. Its
nuns were as mutes, rough, raw-boned, and sullen.
Rosamunde, with her rich soul, was as a queen in
a charnel house, mocked by mere skeletons. The
Abbess had received her, portioned her a cell,
given her a black gown in place of the blue. She
had solemnised her novitiate in the cold grey
chapel, whose walls seemed to shut out the warmth
of heaven. Toil and travail became her lot. She
laboured with the rest in the sour, stony garden,
washed the linen, drew water at the well. Her
white hands grew rough and red apace; her cheeks
became hollow, her bright eyes dim. There were
fasts and vigils, penitences galore. The nuns’
tongues were bridled save for one hour in the day,
and no laughter or joy ever echoed through Holy
Guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde had sought peace there; she discovered
shame and bitterness of spirit. Her ways
were not the ways of those about her, for these
ashy people had forgotten the world with its throes
of passion, its pathos, its tears. There were no
humble poor to need their alms, no sick and palsied
to be cheered and fed. Their creed was narrow and
selfish as their lives. The sea and the wilderness
hemmed them in; they had grown hard and savage,
coarse beyond belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great change came over Rosamunde’s heart
those months. She began to think much of Tristan
and the love he had shown her, how she had
tried him and found him a man. These new
thoughts solaced her those winter months as she
toiled at the well-winch or dug in the garden.
Hallowed by memory, Tristan’s face had lost its
ugliness, gained even a rough beauty as the past
sped back. She recalled his great strength, his
manliness and honour. Even in the incredulous
deeps of her heart, she began to believe that she
would have found a finer haven within Tristan’s
arms than in the wind-swept towers and courts of
Holy Guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The change was very subtle that worked in her
that winter. She disbelieved her own heart at
times, scoffed at her imaginings, yet found that
they remained. Her mood towards Samson had
altered also. It was as the melting of a dream
for the passionate reality of life, a fancy that
seemed as frail as a spider’s gossamer hung with
dew. She had worshipped Samson in her impulsive
way, even because he had bulked a god among
men, a martyr and a prophet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, she had been lonely, lonely to death
those years in Joyous Vale, and had yearned for
the love that had never come. Ronan, her husband,
had sickened her soul with his feeble body,
his pusillanimous mind. Out of the bitterness of
solitude she had conceived romance, and cheated
her heart with vain imaginings. Now in Holy
Guard she had come by the truth, that a woman’s
brain was but the vassal of her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long she began to curse the day when
she had abandoned Tristan for the cloisters of Holy
Guard. She had found no comfort within its
walls, and though her heart cried out there was
no one to comfort her, no one to speak with concerning
the past. The place seemed full of desolation
and death and the voice of the wind. She
yearned for liberty, even for the troublous and
sinful lap of the world. Life, desperate and bitter
though it might prove, was fairer far than a living
grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening she stood and watched the sun
sinking over the sea as she leant against the parapet
of the topmost platform of the place, with the
chapel behind her, dark and dim, the cliffs plunging
sheer to the sands beneath. Holy Guard was
built wall on wall upon the rock, its towers and
roofs climbing the rugged slopes. Thus from its
heights Rosamunde watched the fires dwindle, the
red glow elapse. Blue gloom descended and overarched
the sea. The wind gathered and moaned
as the stars began to shine in the darkening
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An eternal melancholy seemed to cover the
world. The clouds lost their crimson shrouds,
grew grey and colourless, hurried fast before the
wind. There were tears in Rosamunde’s eyes as
she gazed towards the sea, for she was growing
old and her youth was flying; soon she would be
as these nuns, haggard, hard-featured, cold of eye.
Her heart cried out for some great love. Lacking
such love, what was life worth that she should
strive to husband it? Even God seemed far from
her on that lonely crag, and Christ’s face was dark
within the walls of Holy Guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stood brooding, gazing out towards the
sea, where the breakers foamed dimly under the
deepening night, Julia, Mistress of the Novices,
passed by from the chapel with a chain lamp
swinging in her hand. It was contrary to the
rules for nuns to loiter; when not at work or in
chapel or refectory, they were packed in their cells
to pray and meditate. Sister Julia was a woman
of obscure birth, a coarse, brown-faced scold with
the tongue of a Xanthippe. She took much
pride in her post as Mistress of the Novices, since
she could often hector women of nobler birth.
Feminine malice was alive in Holy Guard. Rosamunde
had been subjected to a goodly share thereof
by reason of her estate and the mere insolence of
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the sister accosted her with no great
kindness, glad of an excuse to use her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laggard, to your cell. Draw water for
penance on the morrow. You are too often idle
for so young a wench.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde turned to her with a look of appeal.
There were still tears upon her cheeks, and even
for the sympathy of this round-backed scold she
would have given much, so lonely was she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go, sister,” she said. “I was but watching
the sun go down, thinking of the years that have
gone over my head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Julia sneered, and tilted her nose. It was well
known in Holy Guard that Rosamunde had been
of noble birth. The woman, grained with the
hypocritic egotism of that narrow life, had created
Rosamunde’s downfall with sisterly relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave the past alone, girl,” she said, with a
tightening of her mouth; “it was none too clean
and godly, I warrant. I saw court life in Agravale
before I found Our Lady here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would doubt it?” said Rosamunde, with
a tinge of scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mortify your pride, my wench; we suffer no
fire-flies in Holy Guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor any charity,” said Rosamunde, turning
on her heel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drawing her gown about her—for the wind was
keen—she passed from the terrace down the broad
stairway to the lower platform of the abbey.
Seeking her cell down gloomy passage-ways and
galleries, she sat down on the wood, straw-palleted
bed, miserable at heart, cold in body. The blue
gloom of the night showed through a chink in the
wall, a single star glimmering through with silver
irony. The wind whistled into the cell as into
the narrow throat of an empty tomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet while Rosamunde was moping in Holy
Guard, grieving for liberty and that love she had
lost to the world, Tristan won fame in the Seven
Streams as a bold smiter and a hardy knight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fierce tune in the man’s brain had grown
more strident in the winter weather. “Columbe
and vengeance,” cried a voice, grim and relentless,
deep and unceasing. He lived, prayed, dreamt
for revenge. Strong and terrible in the fanaticism
of his strength, he galloped like a madman over
hill and dale. Nothing was too hard for him,
nothing impossible. His sword played like lightning
through the wilds, for battle and action
seemed to ease his soul. He was a man whose
heart was filled with fire, before whose eyes swept
a mist of blood. Night and noon, Columbe his
dead sister seemed to stand and gaze upon his
face, and ever he would fancy that he heard her
voice amid the rain pelt and the howling wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson had marched out to drive the scattered
garrisons Jocelyn had left from the strong places
of the Seven Streams. Tristan was Samson’s
Talus, his man of iron with the iron flail. Taking
Tor’s Tower as their fountain-head, they had
pushed their forays south and east, smiting sudden
blows out of the dark. It was a war of outposts,
of scattered sieges, of ambushes in the woods.
Honour fell to the swift and the desperate; strength
and subtlety went hand in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In such a war as this Tristan grew terrible, a
man without pity, one who never tired. Samson
had given him two hundred spears, and many of
Blanche’s best knights were content to serve him.
The man with the red shield and the sable pennon
became the scourge and terror of Jocelyn’s men.
Tristan struck mightily and with furious swiftness.
One night he fell upon Sanguelac, a strong place
towards the border, scaled the wall alone, for the
ladder broke behind him. He sprang down into
the court, slew with his axe six men who held the
gate, let his own knights in. The place expiated
Ronan’s town with death and fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following night he fell upon Merdin, a hill
tower some seven leagues away. Though an outpost
from Sanguelac, its garrison knew nothing of
their fellows’ fate. They were drinking and dicing
when Tristan’s men broke in. Such deeds as
these spread terror and panic through the breadth
of the land, for Tristan came like a storm-wind
through the wilds or like an eagle out of the blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Blanche the Duchess, proud lady that
she was, her eyes kindled at the noise of Tristan’s
deeds. Often she rode with him on raid and foray,
content to share the grim chaos of such a war.
Was he not a man after her own heart, knighted
by the stroke of her own sword? Her face would
flush when she heard the sound of Tristan’s
trumpet over the moors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her men whispered together over their camp
fires; they loved their Duchess, were fierce and
jealous for her honour. Yet there was not a man
in their iron ranks who loved not Tristan and
swore by his sword. He was a soldiers’ man, fearless
and hardy, one who could sleep in mud and
scale a tower. “Sanguelac,” “Merdin,” these were
his watchwords. The black eagle should lead
them towards the south.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The night before the southern troops marched for
the north, Agravale gave herself up to riot and
revelry. Though it was winter, the days were
warm, the townsfolk held a carnival in the gardens
of St. Pelinore. The houses were decked with
rich cloths and banners, the churches with boughs
of cypress and yew and garlands of purple amaranth.
Companies of monks passed through the
streets with crosses and reliquaries, chanting under
the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the prologue in Agravale to the storm-cry
of war over the Seven Streams. There was a
veneer of sanctity over the venture, a professed
piety more sonorous than real. Though the priests
paraded the crowded streets, held crosses and relics
to the lips of the people, the taverns teemed, as
did the houses of infamy. The southern folk were
prepared to make war in velvet, and prayed more
for plunder than the good of the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn of that winter day came crisp and
clear, with a sky like crystal, hills and woods
sharply carved against the cloudless blue. The
clangour of trumpets woke the town, with its vanes
and casements mimicking the dawn. Jocelyn had
ordered his Bishop’s chair to be set on a mound
in the meadows without the western gate. Soon
after sunrise he rose and celebrated Mass in the
cathedral church of St. Pelinore. Thence from
the crowded aisles, with their mail-clad worshippers,
he passed in state to his throne in the
meadows, a great following of priests chanting
at his heels. All Agravale had hurried to the walls
and meadows to watch the host march out for the
north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain of the southern companies were already
under arms in the meadows, their lances rising
towards the blue, their shields aflicker in the sun.
The black masses were dusted over with colour,
while many a banner waved in the wind. Behind
the Bishop’s chair was planted the Sacred Standard
of the Golden Keys, destined to flash benedictions
over the soldiers of the Church. A crowd of monks
surrounded the knoll where Jocelyn sat, with the
precentor of St. Pelinore’s to lead the chanting.
The walls and housetops, the glistening fields were
crowded by the townsfolk in holiday dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the western gate the pomp and panoply of
the south poured forth with a sounding of trumpets,
a sparkling of pennons. First came Count
Reynaud with the knights and spears of Vanclure,
some five hundred men in red and green surcoats.
Benedict of the Mountains followed hard on their
heels, with three hundred spears and a company
of archers. The monks about the Bishop’s chair
raised a wild chant that came as a counterblast to
the clangour of the trumpets. The mailed masses
gathered about the Sacred Banner with the Golden
Keys. The whole host shouted, tossed up shield
and lance, while horns and clarions pierced the
din. On the walls the women waved scarves and
kerchiefs, their shrill cries mingling with the
clamour of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn, wearing his mitre and bearing his
cross, stood before the chair to give the sons of the
Church his blessing. He made a noble figure
enough in his splendid robes, jewels and rich cloth
agleam in the sun. There was a complacent pride
on his handsome face; his eyes flashed as he gazed
round on these henchmen in steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sons of the Church,” he cried, with cross upraised,
“the Holy Father has blessed you—behold
here his banner. We march to uphold the decrees
of the Church, to hurl down heresy, to destroy the
wicked. See to it, sirs, that your swords shine
bright. The saints in paradise shall watch over
your souls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men cheered him lustily enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God for His Church!” they cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“St. Pelinore for Agravale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a pealing of trumpets, the whole host was
soon in motion on the great white road, pennon and
casque pouring into the solemn shade of the woods.
Horn answered horn, bugle cried to bugle; the
trampling of the horses thrilled the bright air.
Shields and surcoats shone and shimmered under
the dark pines and ilexes. Thus the Sacred Banner
went out from Agravale to march on Holy Guard
and the Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Jocelyn, his mood changed with the
moods of men. He passed back to his palace to
doff his pontificals for more worldly gear. Since
he was to play the shepherd to this warlike horde,
he would act in keeping with the enterprise before
him. The cross and mitre were well enough in
Agravale; Jocelyn had determined to discard them
for attributes more temporal. He donned a trellised
coat and a steel casque, girded on a long
sword, took an embossed shield. He would lead
his own household knights against the heretics,
strike a blow for the Banner with the Golden Keys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days’ hard marching brought Benedict,
who held the van, within three leagues of the
River Lorient, where it parted the Southern
Marches from the province of the Seven Streams.
It was here that certain grey-faced, mud-bespattered
riders fell in with the vanguard as they came
riding south. They were the remnant of a garrison
that had been driven out of Marvail by
Samson the Heretic, a town beyond the fords of
the River Lorient. The men told how Tristan le
Sauvage stormed hither and thither through the
Seven Streams, falling on outposts, putting garrisons
to the sword. They told also how Samson
and his heretics had been reinforced from the
north, though they were ignorant that Blanche the
Duchess had herself taken the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With such news to set him cogitating, Jocelyn
halted his banners south of the Lorient, and took
counsel with his captains as to what their schemes
should be. To strike at Holy Guard, they had to
cross the river and march along the northern bank
through the enemy’s country. Now Samson the
Heretic was at Marvail with three hundred men,
ignorant, perhaps, that the southern barons had
drawn so near. Samson was the one man in all
Christendom whom the Holy Father desired to see
in chains, and the chance was too flattering for
Jocelyn to eschew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bishop’s tent was pitched in the woods
south of the river, with the crusaders camped
around under cover of the trees. Jocelyn had
called Count Reynaud, Benedict, and several other
barons to him in council. He had determined to
set the necessity of Samson’s capture before his
confederates that night. They were gathered
under the shade of a huge ilex tree, with the great
banner adroop over the embroidered canopy of
the tent. Through the opening they could see the
woods billowing below them to the river valley,
the dark domes of the trees clear cut under the
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn was very suave, yet mightily in earnest.
He gestured with his hands, used the subtlest
modulations of his voice, lifted his eyes to the
darkening heavens as though ever ready to
behold visions, stars portending the triumph of
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember, sirs,” he said, “that our faith constrains
us to save the ignorant from the powers of
those who trade upon their folly. If we could bind
the arch-fiend, how many souls we should preserve
from hell! Even so is it in this war of ours. This
Samson, foul-mouthed blasphemer, perverter of the
Scriptures, has bewitched with his tongue the province
of the Seven Streams. To slay the heresy,
we must slay the arch-heretic. Heaven seems
eager to deliver him even now into our hands.
You, sirs, as men of the sword, are able to deal
with the elements of war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benedict of the Mountains was quick to understand
the churchman’s argument. He and Jocelyn
were cronies of a common cult, and the soldier
would have been more outspoken in the vulgar
sense had not the occasion constrained him to
dignity. Count Reynaud of Vanclure was a good
Catholic and an honest knight, one who hated
coarseness and would not suffer a lie. And since
he was a powerful noble and necessary to the
cause, Jocelyn pandered to his respect with a display
of exaggerated zeal. His great power over the
Count was by the power of fanaticism; even such
a Christian as Reynaud could wax brutal in the
battle for a faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, my lord, you would have us strike at this
Samson, speedily?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn spread his hands, made a pretence of
leaving all technical machinations to their military
intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An ambuscade, a false message, a night
attack,” he said; “these, sirs, are ruses I may
abandon to your strategy. All I desire is that you
shall deliver this blasphemer into my hands, and
I vouch that the Holy Father will bless your
children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man is a lying whelp,” said Benedict, with
a pious leer. “What say you, Sir Reynaud and
gentlemen, to a night attack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord of Vanclure bent his brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson is at Marvail,” he argued, “with three
hundred men. It will be well for us to send out
riders over the river, that we may know whether
the heretics hold the fords, also as to whether
Samson has moved his banner or no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True enough,” quoth Benedict. “Scent out
the bear before you set the dogs on. My light
riders know the ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, sirs,” said Jocelyn, “we are agreed on
this point—if Samson is at Marvail, and the fords
are not held, we will swoop at night and seize the
town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plain as your Mass Book, Bishop,” said he
of the Mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn made the sign of the cross in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless ye, good sons of the Church,” he
said. “The saints are with us. And assuredly ye
shall prosper.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It is the common fate of reformers that they
inspire the enmity both of the ignorant and the
self-seeking, and hence the larger portion of
humanity is arrayed against them. Ruffian and
blinded saint meet and kiss over the corpse of an
innovator. Many a Prometheus is torn and rent
by the insensate malice of the age. The fate of
fools is to live; that of great spirits that they should
be immolated by the savage present for the blessing
of a fairer future. Each martyr lights a beacon
fire that hurls light and splendour within the portals
of the coming century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus when Reynaud of Vanclure fell at midnight
with five hundred men upon the heretics of
Marvail, he butchered them with a good conscience,
in the full belief of the efficacy of the deed. Samson’s
men were caught asleep, snugly housed in
the town. Half armed and dazed, they were
hunted out and slaughtered in the streets. Samson
himself was taken alive while fighting with
his back against a wall; bound and pinioned, tied
upon a horse, led from the town under the escort
of a strong body of men-at-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the news was brought to Jocelyn at the
fords of the Lorient, he gave the messenger a hundred
silver pieces out of his own strong box, licked
his lips, and ordered a triumphal service to be
sung. In the woods under the great ilex trees and
pines the soldiers mustered, while the hoarse chanting
of the monks rose on the silent air. Through
the ranks were carried the Sacred Banner and the
Cross Processional, knights and warriors kneeling,
kissing their naked swords. Samson the arch-heretic
had fallen into their hands; God had greatly
blessed the cause of Holy Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day after the night attack, on Marvail,
Count Reynaud marched south again to the
Lorient, leaving two hundred men to garrison the
town. He was eager to bear so precious and
notorious a burden beyond the river, to deliver
Samson to the mercies of the Church. The Heretic
was brought bound upon a horse, Reynaud’s men
massed round him, tauntingly exultant, flinging
mud and mockery at his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strong soul in Samson rose that day to
meet the doom he knew must follow. There was
no hope for him save in a rescue, and though a
few scattered followers were dogging Count Reynaud’s
march through the woods, they dared not
ambuscade so powerful a force. Samson was in
the hands of fanatics, nay, in the hands of usurers
who extracted bribes from the souls of men. He
had dealt too mightily with these hypocrites with
his tongue to expect much mercy at their hands.
He knew full well that the priests were as vultures,
ready to rend and to destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They forded the Lorient well before noon,
their horses trampling the water, the men smiting
spray at Samson with the shafts of their
lances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leper, be cleansed,” they cried, laughing and
mocking him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold, here is Jordan; cleave a path for us,
O saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson took the taunts in silence, girding his
spirit for this great trial of the flesh. He gazed
at the river, believed that he would be dead before
the water that they forded reached the sea. All
hope lapsed as the Lorient rolled behind and as
he neared the southern bank. The wooded slopes
glittered with steel, for the soldiers of the Church
had thronged down to see the Heretic brought back
in bonds from Marvail. A fierce, mocking outcry
rose from the thickets, a clamour as of wild beasts
tongueing to the slaughter. The road to the ford
seethed with men, a mass of squealing, frenzied
beings, more like the brown savages of primitive
ages than cleansed and baptised Christians. Even
Samson on his death march pitied them with some
measure of pure scorn. He rode unmoved through
the mocking mob, with pale, calm face and steadfast
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew this to be the end of all his struggles,
of his strenuous preaching, his Heaven-inspired
zeal. He had sought to seize the people from the
grip of the priests, men who had traded and fattened
on the frailties of mankind. Had he not
pointed them heavenwards to the great All-Father,
and to the Son who had redeemed the world with
the passion of self-sacrifice? He had preached
against those who had usurped the portals of
heaven, who had blasphemed the Great Spirit by
claiming their own bodies to be the sole channels
of grace. He had cried that man stood face to
face with his Maker, that the Holy of Holies was
in the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Samson rode amid the railing mob that
played around him on the road, his thoughts sped
to Calvary and the crosses there. Should he flinch
from what the Christ had suffered, and from what
the martyrs had rejoiced to bear? The strain of
heroism deepened in his soul, and a divine patience
purged out wrath. It was the fate of prophets to
seal with their blood the truths they expounded
to mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he laboured for nothing? No, the seed
had been sown, and, like a good husbandman, he
could go to his rest. There were strong men who
would take up the challenge, and seize the torch
from his dying hand. He remembered Tristan,
that youthful Titan, who would preach with the
sword what he had preached with the tongue. The
Duchess Blanche had breathed the true spirit, and
there were scores of heralds in the Seven Streams.
Samson was strengthened by such thoughts as
these. He feared not death, since death was not
the end; they could slay the body, but not the
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson was brought before Jocelyn’s tent, torn
from his horse, dragged before the chair where the
Bishop sat. Helmets, wave on wave, swayed on
the hillside; a thousand faces dwindled into the
gloom of the woods. One heavy hand had buffeted
the Heretic’s mouth, yet he stood before
Jocelyn with pale, firm face, blood on his lips,
his eyes unwavering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a peculiar lustre in Jocelyn’s eyes.
His face was suffused; his hands quivered as they
gripped the carved rails of the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, blasphemer, you have fallen to us at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A divine patience showed on Samson’s face,
also the melancholy of a man who grieved but did
not fear. Now and again his dark eyes kindled;
he stood unmoved by the menacing faces that
hemmed him round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bishop,” he said, “boast not thyself blessed
because thou hast conquered dullards with a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Infidel, what hast thou to plead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I have spoken the truth and served God.
That I have not pandered to a greedy Church,
nor cheated men by forged doctrines and by false
decrees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A soldier sprang forward and spat in Samson’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kneel, dog, to the Bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Heretic turned to him with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend, your taunts are brave enough since I
am bound. I kneel to no man, only to God in
Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mocking wave of laughter spread from rank
to rank, for the jest sped home. The rough faces
craning towards the Bishop’s tent were suffused
and contorted with a savage zest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make him kneel, by God!” cried a black-bearded
Hercules with a flash of the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words echoed the will of the mob. Four
men seized on Samson, bore him to his knees,
threw him prostrate, so that his face was bathed
in the trampled mire before the tent. Still his
patience and his dignity withstood them. He
knelt in silence, knowing that mere words were
vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn rose in his pontificals, stretched out a
scornful hand towards the Heretic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, sirs, what shall be done with this
poor anti-Christ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men seemed to catch a wild and savage
echo from the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crucify him! crucify him!” was the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn stood motionless a moment with folded
hands, his eyes turned heavenwards as though in
prayer. The crowd watched him, their glances
wavering betwixt Samson and the Bishop’s face.
It was a full minute before the churchman spoke
again. Then the words fell like a sad condemnation
wrung by duty from a merciful heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, Mother Virgin, and ye holy saints,” he
said, “have pity, we beseech thee, on this sinner’s
soul. In death and after death let him know well
the God whom his proud lips have so blasphemed.
Sons of the Church, I surrender this heretic into
your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great shout rolled up, billowing from the
soldiery crowding from under the trees. The ranks
swayed, broke, stood still a moment. Samson,
with flashing eyes, and face with the calm of death
thereon, had risen from his knees. He stood at
his full height, as Paul before Festus, noble and
undismayed. For one brief instant his voice rang
through the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye men,” he cried, “if I have sinned, God see
to it, and save my soul. I die in the strength of
a holy life, fearing neither death nor the powers
of hell. As for ye priests, never have I lusted
after women nor grovelled after gold. God see to
it, sirs, when the judgment comes, Samson the
Heretic will meet Pope and Bishop undismayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn’s cross went up; there was hot anger
on his face, and a dozen monks pushed forward
through the crowd, calling on the soldiery to work
their will. Samson was seized, thrown down,
trampled upon, drawn savagely by the heels.
Shouting and cursing, the pack drew him into the
wood, while the monks, gathered in a company,
raised a deep chant of thanksgiving over the slaying
of such a sinner. Thus they crucified Samson
on the hills above the Lorient, nailing him to a
tree, naked and covered with wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the Heretic’s patience was as triumphant as
their wrath, nor did his courage fail him in that
hour, and his cry was the cry of a great spirit:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the tidings had passed to the heretics
lurking in the woods, and one of their number
had watched the martyrdom from the bosom of a
great ilex tree. Fierce in their sorrow, they
gathered and swam the river as the night came
down, vowing vengeance for Samson’s death.
Ten men took horse that same night, and rode
north together into the province of the Seven
Streams. They headed for Merdin, where Tristan
and the Duchess were said to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in a valley wild with trees, dark as some
valley of death, that the first of these ten riders
found Tristan marching towards the south. Black crags
towered above; a dark smoke of rain was
rushing before the wind under a granite sky. The
horseman, worn and mud-stained, drenched to the
skin, met Tristan riding at the head of his men,
grim with the weather and the working of his
own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have crucified Samson,” was the man’s
cry, before he fell fainting with hunger and weariness
from off his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samson crucified!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry rang through the rain-drenched ranks.
As for Tristan, he said nothing, but frowned at
the winter sky.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Sea spray was blown upon the rocks of Holy
Guard, the grey sky raved, the trees rocked and
moaned upon the hills. Rain whirled with the
wind. The towers and walls shook; doors chattered;
gallery and court were full of the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight there came the cry of a trumpet
from the troubled darkness of the night. Armed
men were climbing the causeway with rain beating
upon their faces, moisture clinging to their beards.
There came the rattle of a spear staff on the great
gate of the abbey, and again the trumpet challenged
the dark walls, like the cry of a sea-bird
driven by the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twelve nuns and novices were in the chapel
keeping a vigil with the Abbess Joan. For the
rest, Holy Guard and all its sisterhood were
plunged in darkness and in sleep. The porteress
at the gate, nodding over her prayers in the guard
cell, started at the trumpet cry, drew her gown
round her, crept shivering to the grille.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knocks?” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open in God’s name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman drew back the bolts, opened the
wicket, peered out into the gloom. Men, rain-drenched
and cloaked, scrambled in, black shadows
pouring out of the night. Two soldiers seized on
the porteress. A wet, hairy hand was over her
mouth, stifling her cries; she was huddled into her
cell, where a lamp flared with the draught through
the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Armed men still poured in, a tide that swirled
from wall to wall. Rough voices rose amid the
racket of the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lights there; fire the torches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chapel, sirs. Follow me. Ten of you
hold the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall figure led the way like an old grey wolf
heading the hunt, while the pack poured up the
passage-way betwixt the towering walls, finding no
swords to stem their progress. They climbed the
fifty steps that wound in the rock to the main mass
above, scrambling, shouting, plucking at each
other’s belts. Soon they were under the second
arch and within the heart of Holy Guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the chapel Joan the Abbess had been keeping
the vigil of St. Margradel with six nuns and
six novices. Two lamps hung from the wooden
roof, flinging vague streams of light into the
gloom. The Abbess knelt on the stone steps
before the altar, with the women crouching in
cramped reverence at her feet. A single taper
burnt before the rough wooden cross whose beams
were linked by a crown of thorns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overhead the wind screamed, and the rain drove
in through the crazy latticing upon the floor. The
tide was full below, and they could hear the thunder
of the waves upon the rock. Holy Guard was
overarched by darkness and all the turbulent
passion-throes of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trumpet’s cry had passed unheard by those
within the chapel: the rush of many feet had
merged into the vaster clamour of the storm. A
pikestaff smote the chapel door. The rusty latch
clashed, the door swung in on its sea-rotted hinges,
the arch of gloom was filled with hissing torches,
smoke, and the gleaming bodies of armed men.
Joan the Abbess started to her feet, stood with her
back to the altar, her crucifix upraised. The nuns
and novices, some standing, some crouching on
their knees, huddled back towards her like fledgelings
beneath a mother’s wing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence held for a moment, save for the blustering
of the wind and the hiss of the rain on the
burning torches. Joan the Abbess was no coward;
her eyes were fixed questioningly upon the armed
men at the door. Since they made no sign of
entering the chapel, she still held her cross on
high and challenged them from the altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are ye who break the peace of Holy
Guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some stir in the crowd without the
door, and the torches plunged forward, their smoke
rolling to the roof. A tall man in a green cloak,
with a sable hood shadowing his face, had pushed
through the soldiery with drawn sword. His men
stood with crossed spears before the door, while he
faced the Abbess under the flaring lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman still held her cross on high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are ye who trouble Holy Guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the green cloak answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman, the noise of your misdeeds has filled
all Christendom. The Holy Father has decreed
the breaking of the abbey of Holy Guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are false words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man ignored the Abbess’s straining lips
and upraised cross. His eyes were searching the
faces of those who thronged the altar, white and
mute, carven as out of stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise, women, we command you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some obeyed him, others hesitated. Joan the
Abbess still stood before the altar with a few of
the women huddling about her feet. The man in
the green cloak pointed towards her with his
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take her hence, sirs,” he said. “Let her not
cheat you with that cross of hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some scuffling, some screaming, as
in a dovecot where a hawk has entered. The
Abbess calmed the scene by sudden surrender to
the tyranny of the hour. She put the men from
her, folded the crucifix over her breast, passed
down from the altar towards the door. Her
women gathered at her heels like sheep, thronging
betwixt the line of torches and the glistening
helms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the hood of sables suffered them to
pass before him one by one, staring hard into
each frightened face. At each motion of his sword
the soldiers let a woman through, and they passed
singly from the flare of the torches into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last woman had drawn her hood down over
her face. She was taller than her fellows, and
moved with more stateliness, a more youthful
grace. At a sign one of the soldiers tossed back
her hood and uncovered the face of Rosamunde
of Joyous Vale, dead Ronan’s wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the green cloak made a gesture
with his sword. The soldiers herded to the entry,
passed out from the chapel, and closed the creaking
door. The torchlight flickered in through the
lattices; vague cries pierced the clamour of the
storm; the wind screamed, the sea surges thundered
against the rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the sword tossed back his hood.
He and Rosamunde were alone together; the lamps
flung their wavering light down upon his face.
Rosamunde, knowing him in a moment, fell back
and leant against a pillar. It was Jocelyn of Agravale,
who had trapped her in Holy Guard.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>At Sanguelac the Tower of the Dead was lit with
many cressets. Pierced with a hundred ruddy
stars, it lifted its grey parapet to the sky, while the
bells clashed in the belfry near. The men of the
Seven Streams were mourning for Samson their
leader; they wore black scarves over their hauberks,
and had painted black bands athwart their shields.
Tristan had set the bells of the town tolling, in
memory of the great heart that beat no more.
Samson’s mantle had fallen on Tristan’s shoulders;
as for Blanche the Duchess, she was content
to follow him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was night; and in the abbey in the town,
whence such monks had long fled who had not
turned heretics under Samson’s preaching, the
Duchess Blanche was housed with her knights
and nobles. Tristan was with her in the abbot’s
parlour, also Lothaire, her chief captain, and the
knights of her guard. They had framed their
plans for the march on Marvail, where Jocelyn had
left Count Reynaud encamped, while he, proud
regenerator of the Seven Streams, had ridden
towards Holy Guard to obey St. Pelinore. The
Bishop had left Count Reynaud at Marvail, both
to overawe the heretics and to preserve him in
ignorance. So pious a knight might have used
his honour to weigh the balance against Jocelyn’s
romancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the conference ended, Lothaire and his
knights went to their quarters, leaving Tristan
and the Duchess alone together, save for two
women who had attended her from the north.
The night was clear, and through the open window
the winter stars were shining; beneath the
abbey a hundred roofs gleamed down to the midnight
of the woods. Blanche had drawn to the
open window, and Tristan stood by her leaning
on his sword. The two women were stitching a
black cross in the midst of the Duchess’s banner,
a cross that commemorated Samson’s death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche, in the rich autumn of her woman’s
heart, had drawn nigh unto Tristan, even so as
to renew the springtide of her youth. There was
that fierce and uncompromising honour in him
that made him doubly strong in a woman’s eyes.
Moreover, he went heavily through life that winter
season, yet with the grim fatefulness of a man
possessed. Blanche’s heart had opened to his,
half with a maiden’s love, half with a mother’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was morose that night as he stood
beside her staring at the stars. On the morrow
they were to march on Marvail, to smite those
men who had crucified Samson beyond the river.
Storm clouds were massing over the Seven
Streams, and many a fierce soldier had sworn dire
things to his own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess Blanche was troubled for Tristan
as they gazed at the bare woods dark under the
stars. There was that strange tenderness upon
the woman’s face that illumines the countenance
of one who loves. Her eyes were kind under her
silvery hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “must a man live for
vanished days alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his eyes from the heavens, leant
more heavily upon his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The past is ever with us,” he answered her;
“the dead haunt me, stand round my bed at night.
I see not flesh and blood alone, but the grey faces
of those who cry to me for vengeance. They are
not dead, these ghosts—Columbe, nor Samson,
nor the martyrs of the Seven Streams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman leant her head upon her hand, and
gazed out into the night, so that Tristan saw but
the curves of her proud face and bended neck.
There was pathos in her attitude, the pose of one
who yearned for that which life had never fully
given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You live for the dead,” she said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many whom I love are dead,” he answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw a glance at him, her eyes bright with
the wistfulness that she could not hide. Tristan
was blind to that which was in her eyes. For the
moment he thought only of Rosamunde, walled
from the world in Holy Guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are all the loved ones dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught a deep breath, did not answer her
speedily and frankly as was his wont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the heart goes,” he said; “the rest is
nothingness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothingness; there you belie your soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes gleamed suddenly, as though he heard
some mocking trumpet cry and the trampling
squadrons of his foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before God,” he said to her, lifting the weight
of his body from off his sword, “he who has lost
friends to death, finds no soft resting-place to ease
his soul. A little while—some months ago, not
more—I leapt like a boy into the storm and
strife of life. My youth is past, my manhood
forged beneath the mighty hammer of God’s fate.
When dreams elapse, the strong man grips the
sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange words,” she said, “for one who is
not old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leant his hands again upon the pommel,
sighed, and retorted to her with the solemnity of
one whose hopes were fierce, whose thoughts ran
deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There seems a season in man’s life,” he said,
“when all is wrath, passion, and great pain.
Youth passes in a year. The world grows full
of storm winds, anguish, and huge travail. Battle
breathes in the blood. A man must fight and
labour, or grow mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” he said, catching her very words,
“my heart gives out at seasons, and I yearn, even
I, to be once more a little child weeping my woes
out on my mother’s knees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess turned to him from the mild stars,
held out her hands, a woman whose heart was open
as the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan, is it a mother’s heart you
need?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her sadly, knelt down and kissed
her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, let me comfort you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lifting his rough face to hers, he smiled, the
smile of a man grateful yet not appeased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Winter is here,” he said; “as yet there is no
peace upon the woods, no singing of birds, no
white clouds in the heavens. For me—battle and
tempest. I shall not rest till many deeds are
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morrow they marched from Sanguelac,
with pennons tossing over hill and moor. Tristan
bore a black dragon on a gilded shield, the device
Dame Blanche had decreed to him after her sword
had touched his shoulder. Three thousand spears,
a strenuous van, pricked with him hotly through
the winter wilds. Morose and fierce of face, Tristan
held on towards the south, with Blanche the
Duchess at his side. They were riding on Marvail
to take it by surprise, fall suddenly upon
Count Reynaud and his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well towards evening on the third day
of Tristan’s sallying from Sanguelac that the
watchers on the walls of Marvail saw scattered
knots of horsemen cantering towards the town.
The gates were thrown open to take them in.
Even in the farther meadows on the rim of the
woods the townsfolk could see the flash and glimmer
of pursuing spears. Mud-stained, sullen-faced
men rode in to Marvail, confessing defeat
in every desperate gesture, some with wounded
comrades laid across their saddles, their shields
splintered, their lances lost. That morning Count
Reynaud had sallied out to give the heretics battle.
His scouts had found them marching south, and
had misjudged their numbers, since Tristan and
the Duchess had masked half their companies in
the woods. Count Reynaud had cantered out
with horns blowing, shields aglimmer, spears
aglint. The men of Marvail had watched them
sally, promising the Church more victims before
the sun should set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two leagues from the town, on a hill amid the
black billows of the woods, Tristan stood at the
head of his main squadrons, gazing round over
the place where their hot charge had left the
wreckage of Reynaud’s arms stranded on the hillside.
The west was afire above the pines, crimson
swords smiting through the clouds. It had
been a battle of horse, grim, swift, and furious.
Tristan had ambushed a thousand spears under
Lothaire in the woods. They had charged home
on the Papists’ flank, crumpled their squadrons,
hurled them back up the hill. Tristan and his
men had come in like the sea. Sword and shield
were witnesses to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood amid the wreckage of the fight,
with the Duchess beside him on her great white
horse. The banner with the black cross drooped
amid a grove of spears. Far to the south, through
the dusky woods, Lothaire’s spears still flashed
and smote at the flying foe. On all sides were the
dead and the dying, piled in sheaves, the grim
harvest of battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Tristan’s feet lay the body of Count Reynaud
thrust through with a spear. Before him
among the slain stood some dozen monks guarded
by men-at-arms. They had followed Count Reynaud
from Marvail to bless his banner and to see
the heretics put to the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan le Sauvage leant upon the long handle
of his axe. A prisoner had been brought to him,
an esquire of Reynaud’s who had been taken in
the fight. Tristan’s eyes were fixed upon the
man’s slashed face as he questioned him concerning
Jocelyn and the main body of the southern
host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, sir, let us have the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of the monks lifted up their hands,
charging the man to seal his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parley not with a heretic,” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Receive martyrdom,” cried another, “and be
blessed in heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan turned on them with a grim scorn.
He was in no mood for argument; that priests
were mischievous rogues was his honest conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are they who slew Samson,” he said,
pointing at them with his axe. “Guards, take and
hang them in the woods. Every priest shall hang
who falls to me in the Seven Streams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men obeyed him with no mean zest, fierce
to be avenged on Samson’s enemies. Twelve
frocked figures were soon jerking and struggling
under the trees. Tristan, stern about the eyes,
turned once again to the man before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, friend,” he said, “this is the fortune
of war. We are rid of these skirted fools; as
soldier to soldier I offer fair terms. Tell me of
Jocelyn and the men of Agravale, or hang beside
the monks on yonder trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reynaud’s squire was young and lusty, not
ripe for death either in years or spirit, and Tristan’s
challenge worked his conversion. He began
to confess such things as Tristan had desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Bishop has marched on the west,” he
said, “even, sir, because he was so guided by St.
Pelinore in a vision at Agravale. He had some
three thousand spears following the Sacred Banner
of the Golden Keys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan nodded and smiled the man on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The vision, friend, tell us that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reynaud’s esquire was white and faint from
the blood lost to him by his wounds. Tristan
cheered him on, bade the two guards support his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten more words, man, and we will see to your
wounds,” he said. “Whither has the Bishop
marched with the spears of Agravale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, to the abbey of Holy Guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, for what purpose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To destroy it, as he was bidden in his vision
by St. Pelinore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man fell forward fainting in the arms of
his guards. They laid him down beside dead
Reynaud, began to search his wounds and to pour
wine between his lips. Blanche the Duchess was
watching Tristan’s face. She saw his eyes flash
and kindle, his mouth harden into a grim line.
It was as the face of a man who heard of the
dishonouring of one he loved. Tristan stood
motionless, leaning on his axe, gazing far into the
burning west, and once his lips moved as though
he uttered a woman’s name.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Samson the Heretic’s death had cast Tristan into
savage gloom. He had loved the man, and had
learnt to lean on him as on a spiritual father, by
whose warm eloquence the heavens were opened.
Samson had been as a great beacon fire lighting
a dark land, startling with his fierce beams the
night-ridden gates of the Church. The light was
quenched, the mighty spirit sped, and Tristan
mourned for him as for a father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then had come the news of Holy Guard, and
the breaking of Rosamunde’s novitiate there.
There was joy and sorrow commingled in the tale.
In one great burst of bitterness, Tristan had
opened his whole heart to the one soul on earth
whose sympathy seemed as a silver cloud charged
with kindly dew. Blanche had heard him to the
end, wiped out the twisting pain from her own
face, given him such comfort as a woman’s heart
could give. Her gracious queenliness stood her in
good stead, and Tristan did not guess the inward
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the man was a man again before one
night had passed. Holy Guard had fallen;
Jocelyn and his war-wolves were by the sea. Tristan
swore by God and high Heaven that he would
ride and fall upon him before the news of Reynaud’s
slaying could reach the Bishop’s ears. The
Papists had fled out of Marvail like Gadarene
swine, and retreated over the river for fear of Tristan’s
sword. As for the heretics, they sallied over,
found Samson’s body hanging naked on a tree.
They took him down and buried him in the woods,
swore over his grave to rid the Seven Streams of
Jocelyn’s power. Then they forded the Lorient
once more, and leaving a strong garrison at
Marvail, hastened by forced marches towards
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News, Sir Tristan, news, news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So cried the rider who came in from the west,
on a muddy horse under the winter sky. The
dawn had streaked the east with faint gold, and
transient sun shafts had touched the woods. In a
glade amid pines Tristan’s scout had found many
horses cropping the coarse grass. Rough huts
had been built of pine boughs piled against the
trees, and many spears stood there with shields
swinging in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan heard the man’s tidings as he stood
before the doorway of his lodge of pine boughs
and laced the steel hood to the rim of his helmet.
His knights were gathering in on every side, some
girding on their swords, others tightening their
shield straps as they came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Pope’s men are three leagues away,”
so ran the morning’s greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan ordered a single horn to sound the
sally, while he passed to the great red tent of
Blanche the Duchess to greet her and to persuade
her to keep from the fight. The glade was full
of stir and action. Companies were forming up
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed;
horses steamed in the brisk morning air. The
banner of the Duchess stood unfurled before her
tent; she had heard the news and the whistling
wings of the eagles of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche came out to meet him in her burnished
casque, her dark eyes afire with the zest of action.
She would have none of Tristan’s caution, but
ordered her white war-horse forward, mounted
from Tristan’s knee, received the shouts of her
eager soldiery. The red tent sank down; the followers
were packing the baggage. As the sun
cleared the trees, the northern van rolled out from
the woods into a stretch of open land that sloped
towards the bold curves of a river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That morning Tristan was merry as he swung
his axe and felt his horse rise under his weight.
He was full of joy, this rugged smiter, who had
sprung from an adventurous quest into the marshalling
of armies. The great heart of the world
seemed to beat with his. Blanche the Duchess
read his humour, joined with him in the zest of
the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you are merry,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merry indeed, for we fight to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You smile once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall smile in that hour when Jocelyn
crawls at my feet. Ha, it is good to be
strong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s riders were scouring ahead, keeping
cover, scanning the horizon for Jocelyn’s march.
By noon they had left the open land, plunged up
hills covered thick with woods. Tristan’s squadrons
sifted through, and he halted them in the
woods under the brow of the hill, went forward
with his captains to reconnoitre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below lay a broad valley running north and
south, chequered with pine thickets and patches of
brushwood. On a hill in the centre stood a ruined
tower. Towards the south a broad loop of the
river closed the valley, while all around on the
misty hills shimmered the giants of the forest,
mysterious and silent. Tristan’s outriders had
fallen back and taken cover in the thickets. Down
the valley could be seen a line of spears, glittering
snake-like towards the tower on the hill. Companies
of horse were crossing the river, pushing
up the slopes, mass on mass. In the midst of the
flickering shields and spears blew a great white
banner streaked with gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Jocelyn and the southern barons, who
had been on the march since dawn. They had
thrown their advance guard across the river, and
were straggling up the green slopes, while the
main host crossed at the ford. On the instant
Tristan did a cunning thing. He had brought
from Marvail Count Reynaud’s banner, also the
pennons of many of his knights slain on the field.
These he sent forward in the van of a strong company,
bidding them close within a hundred paces
and then charge at the gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Papists fell to the trick even as Tristan
had trusted. They straggled up to meet the men
riding under Reynaud’s banner, only to discover
spears rocking towards them at the cry of a trumpet,
a line of plunging hoofs thundering down the
slope. The woods belched steel. North, east,
and west, company on company poured from the
trees and raced full gallop for the disordered host.
Jocelyn’s men were caught like sheep on a hillside.
The hurtling spears were on their shields,
they were hurled back down the valley upon
the disordered masses who had crossed at the
ford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knights of the north and the heretics of
the Seven Streams went in at the gallop, and gave
the southerners no space to breathe. “Remember
Samson!” was the cry. Down towards the river
the whirlwind played, with dust and clangour and
the shriek of steel. Spears went down like
trampled corn. The battle streamed down the
bloody slope, for nothing could stem that furious
charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river shut the broken host in, for the ford
was narrow, not easy of passage. From the north
came the thundering ranks of horse, on the south
the waters were calm and clear. Jocelyn’s squadrons,
streaming like smoke blown from a fire by a
boisterous wind, were hurled in rout upon the
water. They were thrust down over the bank;
slain in the shallows, drowned in struggling to
cross at the ford. Some few hundreds reached the
southern bank, and scattered fast for the sanctuary
of the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than half an hour from the first charge,
Tristan’s heretics had won the day. They gave
no quarter, slew all who stood. Of Jocelyn’s host
some two thousand perished, many in the battle,
many in the river. Tristan rode back up the hill,
amid the cheers of his men. He had chosen three
hundred spears to surround the Sacred Banner
with the Golden Keys, trusting that the Bishop
would be lodged near by. He had bidden his
men take Jocelyn alive, and all such priests as had
followed in his train. That Jocelyn had seized
Rosamunde out of Holy Guard he guessed right
well, and therefore he charged his men to deal
gently with those about the Sacred Banner, to
make prisoners, to slay but few.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence when Tristan rode up victorious from
the ford, he saw the Pope’s banner flying by the
ruined tower, with dead Ronan’s flag waving
beside it. Tristan’s three hundred had taken the
Bishop, thrown him straightway into the tower,
and massed their ranks on the slopes of the hill.
The prize was theirs, and they were eager to guard
it. Some fifty priests had been taken also, but
of Rosamunde of Holy Guard they had seen no
sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche herself rode down on her great white
horse to greet Tristan and give him the victory.
She had watched the battle from the cover of the
woods, and had seen the Papists hurled into the
river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend, God has blessed ye; the wolves have
been hounded from the Seven Streams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was her greeting as she met Tristan before
the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, the victory is yours,” he said.
“Without your aid we should have done but
little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, it is Samson’s victory,” she answered
sadly. “Behold, the dead conquer after death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan dismounted and entered the ruined
gateway of the tower. The men-at-arms, gathering
round, shouted his name, “Tristan, Tristan!”
The hoarse cheers echoed to the listening woods,
waking the welkin, rolling towards the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn, pacing to and fro within the round
walls, heard these cries and bit his lip. He was at
the mercy of the man who had slain Ogier, the
man whose sister he had brought to the grave.
The heretics had thrust the Bishop into the bottom-most
chamber of the tower; the beams and roof
above had rotted away, leaving the open sky racing
above the battlements. Ferns, grasses, and
gillyflowers grew upon the walls and in the crumbling
recesses where the windows opened. The
floor was strewn with rotting wood, overgrown
with brambles and tall rank weeds. From this
lower room three narrow windows looked out upon
the woods, and ruin and decay seemed symbolised
therein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soldier and churchman came face to face within
the narrow compass of those walls. Tristan thrust
back the rotting door, stood alone in the shadow,
seeming the more grim and burly in the narrow
space. The priest went to and fro like a caged
cat, his eyes roving from Tristan’s face to the
door and the spear points that gleamed on the
stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without, the listening soldiery heard the
fierce thunder of a strong man’s voice, grim and
terrible in the intensity of its wrath. Its echoes
reverberated through the tower, pitiless and
damning, cowing the thin tones that sounded
in retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan did not slay the man that day, for he
had other tortures in his heart. With the cold
steel before his eyes and a great hand upon his
throat, Jocelyn jerked out the truth into Tristan’s
face. Rosamunde had been sent by river into the
Southern Marches to be housed at the madhouse
in the mere. Tristan beat the pommel of his
sword in Jocelyn’s face, hurled him against the
wall, left him huddled white and terrified amid
the weeds and rotting wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie there, Satan,” he said. “Death can wait
till I have worked my will.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Over the madhouse in the mere the noon sun had
travelled, drawing the grey mists up from the
meadows, glistening upon the pinnacles of the
wooded hills. No wind was moving—the withered
sedges were silent in the shallows, and no ripples
barred the water with dim gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the island came a solitary cry, the scream
of a living thing in pain, shrill, piteous, and discordant.
All the dismal babels of the place seemed
to wake at the cry like the screaming of birds
when some savage spoiler haunts the woods. The
impassive trees moved never a finger, though echo
veiled among the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the court, with the grey stone walls and the
barred windows rising round, Nicholas the keeper
had betaken him to his whip. A girl, naked to
the loins, stood chained by her wrists to the
wooden post in the centre of the court. She was
a mad creature, given to wild outbursts of delirious
violence. Old Nicholas had taken her when exhausted
after some such fit, had chained her to
the post for the chastening of her temper. Though
the red weals showed in the white skin, her outcry
and her writhings availed her nothing. The
whip was the old man’s one appeal to those contumacious
creatures who needed discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a long, low-ceilinged chamber under the
tiles sat Rosamunde of Joyous Vale, listening to
the cries that came from the distant court. The
room was richly garnished in its way with hangings
and carved furniture, and lamps of bronze.
The three windows opened on the western sky,
the wild crags above, the woods and the calm
water spread below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Rosamunde was seated on a carved
bench, gazing out on the woods steeped in the
double mysteries of sunshine and of mist. Her
hands were in her lap, her undressed hair falling
in gold upon her shoulders. The look upon her
face spoke of deep misery, of passionate degradation,
and shame of soul. Her proud neck was
bent like the stem of a sun-parched flower. She
sat motionless in the shadow, gazing solemn-eyed
upon the empty world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near her, throned on a scarlet cushion upon
the floor, a pale-faced girl peered at herself in
a small hand-mirror, while she combed her black
hair with a silver comb. She was studious and
deliberate in her toilet, perfecting it with a flippant
airiness of gesture that told of a sensuous and
cheerful vanity. Ever and again she would cast
quick, bird-like glances at Rosamunde before the
window, smile to herself with a world-wise pity in
her hazel eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, sister Rose, be merry, be merry. If I
were an escaped nun, I should be laughing till the
sun looked big as a great shield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a certain hollowness in the girl’s
merriment, as though her tongue were blither than
her heart. Rosamunde half turned to her with the
air of one burdened with utter weariness of soul
and body. Life had seemed a black dream since
that wild night in Holy Guard when Jocelyn and
his men had hounded the nuns into the wind and
rain. The memory of that violent midnight lived
with a vivid horror that haunted her soul. At
dawn she had been taken through the wilds,
brought to the river, thrust into a galley, and
rowed upstream into the depths of the woods. For
two days and a night she had heard the plash
of oars, watched the banks swimming by under
a dreary canopy of mist. Then the men had
landed her, set her upon a horse, brought her
through leagues of woodland to the madhouse in
the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl Miriam who shared her chamber
with her was a little Jewess, volatile, passionate,
and warm of heart. A child of misfortune, cursed
with the bane of beauty, she had suffered many
things at the world’s mercy. Yet under the mask
of vice and ignominy, the passion and fervour of
her race still burnt unquenched. At Rosamunde’s
first coming she had taunted and gibed at her.
Later, the utter misery in the elder woman’s eyes
had disarmed her vanity and touched her heart.
Different as gold and wax, the pair had become
friends by common necessity in their prison chamber
under the tiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister Rose,” said the girl again, “I have
never yet won a smile from your lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can smile, child, when one hears the
cries of those in pain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the mad folk, they suffer always; it is
their curse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we, Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We only suffer when our souls are sad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde had heard from the Papists of
Samson’s death; the tidings had shocked her, yet
not with the profundity she would have dreamt of
months ago. He had been her spiritual father
and the great regenerator of the Seven Streams.
To Rosamunde those later months he had been
more of a god than a mortal; Tristan, outshone at
the first, had brought back her heart from a garden
of impossible dreams. From Jocelyn and his men
she had won no other news save that their spears
were set against Tristan and his heretics. They
had taunted her with the promise to bring a sackful
of ears taken from the detestable degenerates who
had defied the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My soul, but you are as sorrowful as Rachel,”
said the black-haired girl, twisting near on her
cushion and half resting against Rosamunde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been a poor fool,” said she, with one
hand on Miriam’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We women are all fools; the men cheat us
into bondage. Once I was clean and pure. Well,
well, what if I have an old heart in a young
body?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde held her peace for the moment.
The cries had ceased in the court below; the babel
of mad voices had given place to silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought of death, Miriam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Jewess started, stared up into Rosamunde’s
face. It was white and hard, the eyes full of a
passionate pessimism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death, sister!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a Roman woman would have died. Ah,
my God, is it then a sin to end such shame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam struggled to her knees, her arms thrust
over Rosamunde’s shoulders. The warm Jewish
blood in her had taken fire of a sudden. Her pale
face looked into Rosamunde’s, her dark eyes glittered
with an earnestness that was almost super-natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, what words are these?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame or death—I halt between the two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death, but how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A steel point, a mere bodkin prick, and then
the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger woman clasped her arms about
Rosamunde’s neck, looked steadily into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, you frighten me. Why then should
we die? Is there no hope left, no gleam of a new
dawn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is hope in prayer, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my fathers have prayed of old and have
been answered. The Great God reigneth, though
I, His daughter, have erred in the tents of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The misery melted out of Rosamunde’s eyes
for the moment. She touched Miriam’s hair with
her fingers, drew a deep breath, inspired new
courage. Her mouth softened; she kissed Miriam
upon the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget, child,” she said; “it was a moment’s
weakness with me, and it has passed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little Jewess took the kiss, broke forth into
sudden weeping. Her heart was warm yet under
her gay gown; the faith of her fathers was not
dead within her breast. The spirits of Ruth and
of Rachel might have wakened echoes in her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I have felt such fearful thoughts of old,”
she said, “when I was drawn down into the dust
and men trampled on my honour. Yet hope
revived, and I lived on. Often I have thought
that shame has broken all my heart, that I am too
sinful to look into the face of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde kissed Miriam’s lips a second time;
it was her turn to comfort, and the instinct gave
her courage. A long while she spoke to her, telling
of the Christ, pleading as the saints had
pleaded in the past. As for the girl, she threw
her mirror and her silver comb away, plucked the
bright brooch from off her breast, sat listening at
Rosamunde’s knees till evening fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the Lady of Joyous Vale lay long
awake, thinking of Tristan and his great love.
Her heart cried out for a strong man’s chivalry,
for the passionate tenderness of such a homage.
Holy Guard and Jocelyn had broken her pride;
she was as a child once more lifting her face to the
lips of love. To be saved from shame, this was
her prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lying awake in the moonless gloom, tossing
under the coverlet with her hair spread around,
she listened to Miriam’s quiet breathing. The
casements showed grey in the wall before her.
Feverish, she rose up from her bed, drew a cloak
round her, knelt by one of the open windows.
The night air played upon her face. Overhead a
thousand stars were shining, while the silent lake
glimmered beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde bowed herself over the sill, leant
her head upon her arms, and wept from sheer pain
and weariness of heart. Life seemed sealed against
all hope. Violence and infamy hemmed her in;
she was mewed in this island amid mad folk and
worse, the idle sport of a worthless priest. She
had become again as a little child, hungry for
love, afraid of the dark. Her heart cried out for
Tristan there, that rough face lit by its honest eyes,
that strength that no single arm could stay. He
was the one man who could win her soul, guard
her from all terror and the world’s evil leer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she wept that night under the stars, she
made a passionate prayer to Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God,” cried her heart, “send Tristan hither.
Grant that he may love me as he loved of old.
Hear this my prayer, O Father of heaven. For
lo, I have broken the pride in my heart, and lo, I
love Tristan, and would be his wife. Hear me,
God, and save me from shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knelt a long while gazing up at the stars.
The tears came no more to dim her eyes; a sudden
wind stirred the trees in the garden. The sound
seemed as a still voice answering her prayer, a
voice that whispered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, God has heard thee.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>While Rosamunde was held a prisoner in the
madhouse in the mere, Tristan and the Duchess
had turned back from the west and marched again
on Marvail and the fords of the Lorient. Having
dealt with Jocelyn and dispersed his people, they
were ready to revenge them for Samson’s death,
and for the ruin wrought in the Seven Streams.
They had sworn together, they and their nobles,
to humble Agravale and to end the crusades that
the priests had preached in that same city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Marvail Tristan had set craftsmen at work
upon two coffins of seasoned wood. The larger
was framed for Jocelyn the Bishop; Tristan had
him laid alive therein, and the lid fastened over
him with thongs of leather. Two holes were left
in the lid over Jocelyn’s face, so that he might
breathe and take his food. Imprisoned thus, he
was carried on a litter pole on the march, while
beside him was borne the empty coffin covered with
the Sacred Banner blessed by the Pope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late that winter Tristan and the Duchess
crossed the Lorient and encamped near to Samson’s
grave. They set their men to raise a great
mound over the place, and having cut down the
tree on which Samson had been crucified, they
fashioned from it a great cross. This they set on
the summit of the mound as a trophy to him who
had conquered in death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the fords of the Lorient and the city
of Agravale lay some twenty leagues of forest land,
more dark and rugged than the province of the
Seven Streams. Here and there were villages hid
in the deep gloom of the woods. A few abbeys
and religious houses slept grey and solemn in the
wilderness, their fish ponds glimmering amid the
green. Many strange beasts lurked within its
shadows and many barbarous folk but half claimed
by the Church. From the fords of the Lorient
even to the cliffs of Agravale a squirrel might have
journeyed from tree to tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into this wild region Benedict of the Mountains
had plunged with the few hundred men who had
escaped from the slaughter in the west. Hither
also had gathered the remnant of those who had
fled from Marvail after Count Reynaud’s death.
They had gathered their scattered companies on
the way to Agravale, and were arming the rude
peasantry to march once more on the Seven
Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By Samson’s grave Tristan and the Duchess
took counsel together with all the nobles of the
north. Samson’s mantle had descended on Tristan,
and though he had not the Heretic’s tongue,
he had sufficient ardour to serve the cause. Even
the older men suffered his youth, for he had given
proof of his great strength, and was honest enough
to be advised when in need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Agravale,” he said, “that, sirs, I take it,
is our common cry. Since we have Jocelyn in
our hands, we cannot leave our work half
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Destroy the lair,” quoth Lothaire of the Isles,
“and the bear will rear no more cubs within. We
men of the north are ready to follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So said they all about the board, for the
Duchess had given Tristan her signet ring as a
token that he had her will in the war. Some
spoke of marching straight for the south, braving
the forest and all its perils. Others were for bearing
towards the sea, where they might reach Agravale
by the banks of the Gloire. But Tristan had
nurtured more in his heart than a mere march
through the forest with skirmishes by the way if
Benedict of the Mountains stood to oppose them.
Rosamunde, he knew, was in the madhouse in the
mere, and therefore safe for him, moated from the
woods. The winter had been dry, with but little
rain, and for days a strong wind had blown from
the north-west, and the dead wood and leaves were
brittle as tinder. It was Tristan’s plan to fire the
forest with a line of beacons carried south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nobles of the north were well content with
some such strategy as this. They parted their
host into three great companies, Lothaire taking
one, Sir Didcart of the Hills another, Tristan and
the Duchess keeping the third. After swearing
troth over Samson’s grave, they marched south
from the fords of the Lorient, prepared to follow
Tristan’s plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though to humour them, the wind freshened
still further, and veered towards the north. Grey
clouds raced in the sky overhead, and the tall trees
moaned and swayed on the hills. Tristan saw
that the hour had come. All day his men had
laboured on the rim of the forest, hewing down
trees, gathering brushwood and dead branches.
They had built twelve great pyres each more than
two furlongs apart, where the flames could strike
at once into the forest. Lothaire and Sir Didcart
were marching south, stacking up beacons as they
went, ready for the signal from the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third night after the taking of the oath
over Samson’s grave Tristan gave the word for
the firing of the forest. He was posted with
Blanche on the crest of a hill where they could
watch the lighting of the beacons. The wind
moaned over the trees, and a myriad black spires
waved in the wind like sharp billows on a heavy
sea. Clouds were scudding fast in the heavens,
with a new moon peeping through and through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Red streaks played about the outermost thickets
where men with torches ran to and fro. Soon the
red streaks lengthened into yellow spears while
smoke billowed southwards with the wind. The
flames smote upwards and licked at the trees,
curling round trunk and waving top, spreading
fans of flame from a thousand boughs. The pyres
grew into pyramids of fire, great golden obelisks
blazing to the sky. From the fords of the Lorient
the message sped, leaping leagues into the night.
Lothaire’s men saw the beacons gleam, and kindling
their torches, linked the chain up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Blanche kept watch upon the hill,
their knights round them in silent awe. The tall
trees were wrapped in shrouds of flame, and the
smoke of their burning hung like a thunder-cloud
overhead. Onwards with the wind the fire rolled,
bringing the giants of the forest to earth, till
glowing rivers streamed towards the south to meet
and merge into a sea of fire. It was as some vast
second chaos devouring the world, a burning judgment
hurled down from heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood leaning on his sword with the
joy of a fanatic on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See how the south burns!” he cried, stretching
out his hand. “Martyrs and innocents,
behold your vengeance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden thought seized him as he watched
the spreading fire. Calling to the men who were
gathered round him, he pealed his deep voice into
their ears, for the cry of the forest was as the roar
of the sea. Figures struggled forward out of the
gloom, bearing the coffin that held Jocelyn of
Agravale. The bands were unfastened and the
priest lifted out, for he could scarcely use his
cramped limbs. Cowering before Tristan, he
blinked at the scene as though called from the
grave to face his doom. The forest lay a great
sea of fire, and southwards the flames ravaged the
night, till the distant hills awoke and grew grey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood beside the priest and pointed to
the forest with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold your bishopric,” he said. “Here we
may show ye the likeness of hell.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, walking within the madhouse garden,
where cypresses and dusky laurels hid the grey
stone wall, saw a haze of gold steal into the sky
towards the north. It was towards twilight and a
strong wind blew, ridging the lake with foam,
tossing the cypress boughs, moaning over the
house. Rosamunde, puzzled by the glow towards
the north, called to Miriam, who had been spinning
in the room above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Either the Jewess was asleep or the wind
drowned the cry, for no face showed at the narrow
window. From the garden an outer stair built
on stone pillars led to a postern opening into the
women’s room. Rosamunde had been given the
key of this door; for the garden had been surrendered
to her by Jocelyn’s orders. The mad folk
were never loosed from their vaults; there were
two soldiers besides old Nicholas and his wife to
keep watch and ward over the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, climbing up the stone stair, found
Miriam asleep on her bed in the corner. She did
not trouble to wake the Jewess, but turned to the
near window and looked out over the water. Twilight
was descending, and the towering woods were
steeped in the hoarse mystery of a winter’s eve.
The crags in the west were edged with gold, and
a luminous mist poured up towards the clouds.
Above the black spires of the waving trees the sky
was lurid, yet not with the sunset. Purple masses
of vapour played over the forest, and there was a
hot, parched perfume on the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, troubled by the strange face of
the sky, turned and woke Miriam from her sleep.
Together they stood on the landing at the top of
the stone steps and watched the red glow increase
in the heavens. There was some huge power striding
over the woods; its sound swelled the piping
of the wind, a far roar as of the voice of a rising
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam clung to Rosamunde’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wild sunset,” she said, not guessing the
truth. “Pah! what a strange scent on the wind.
How black the woods seem. We shall have a
storm in the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde looked out on the scene in silence,
with Miriam’s breath upon her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no sunset,” she said at last; “it is not
the full west, and there is no break in the clouds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means, then, the light in the sky,
sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A forest fire,” said Rosamunde slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, we shall burn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The water is broad enough to hold us safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden cry pealed out over the mere, where
old Nicholas was standing in his boat, poling back
towards the island. He lifted a hand, pointed to
the sky, bent to his work, and brought the boat
over with foam at the prow. Voices answered him
from the landing stage, where his old wife and two
soldiers were watching the sky. They entered the
court when Nicholas had moored his boat and
clapped to the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde and Miriam leant against the stone
balustrading of the stairway, watching the distant
fire. The increasing grandeur of the scene reacted
differently upon the two, inspiring fear in the
Jewess and an unconscious calm in the Lady of
Joyous Vale. A broad glare now hung as a curtain
above the trees, and against it rose a thousand
moving things. The sky grew full of screaming
birds sweeping in terror from the breath of the
fire, their wings whirring and panting towards the
south. Some swooped for the island, settled on
the roof and walls, or plunged, chattering, into the
garden beneath. A great raven perched on the
tiles overhead, and sat there croaking like a messenger
of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the contrasted blackness of the forest
foreground rose the aureole of the approaching
fire. Pennons of flame tongued towards the
heavens, while vast masses of smoke merged into
the clouds. The glare began to play upon the
surface of the mere, splashing the waves with
ruddy gold, gleaming on the foam as it swept
from the west. The distant peaks caught the
earthly lightning from afar; the roar of the great
furnace gathered and grew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as the two women watched in silent awe,
the meadow lands edging the lake seemed alive
with hurrying shadows. The gloom teemed with
desperate life. The wild beasts of the wood came
panting out, herding and struggling towards the
water. The wolf and the hare were flying together;
the boar and the stag galloped side by
side. Droves of wild pigs broke out in black
masses, while above, with a perpetual whirr of
wings, birds pinioned with the wind from the drifting
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The live things were soon fighting in the shallows,
trampling each other, bellowing and howling.
The water grew alive with struggling beasts
where a pack of wolves had taken to the mere and
headed for the island. They crawled ashore by
the stage, trotted hither and thither, their ululations
making the night more terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever the fire came nearer, beating up to heaven,
rolling southwards with palpitating splendour. A
vast canopy of smoke had overspread the valley.
Soon the deep gloom of the near thickets grew
streaked with light as with the gleaming through
of some rich sunset in scarlet and gold. Trees
were falling in the forest, and the wind blew as
from a furnace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde and Miriam stood still at the top of
the stone stair. The terror of the night stupefied
the senses, numbed even fear by the chaos of its
splendour. It was as the end of all things upon
earth, when the myriad wings of angels should
dome the heavens, and the universe should elapse
in fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thousand demoniac voices seemed to answer
the howling of the wolves. All about the island
the beasts padded, casting up their snouts, giving
tongue to swell the midnight chorus. The voices
of the madhouse were as the voices of hell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde and the Jewess drew back from
the stairway into the room, stood shivering at the
door, listening to the uproar beneath. They heard
a sound as of splintered wood, yells of exultation,
old Nicholas’s voice fierce yet faint, the terse
cracking of his whip. Rosamunde, white and
fearful, seized Miriam’s arm, spoke in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mad folk have broken loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to their cries. They will slay old
Nicholas. Quick, we must keep them out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They clapped to the door, locked and bolted it,
dragged up the beds and benches, piled them
against it. As they laboured, panting with fear,
a great bird flapped in by the open window, beat
blindly about from wall to wall. Rosamunde ran
and closed the casement frame, casting a rapid
glance at the burning forest. Smoke and a myriad
ruddy stars were flying athwart the heavens. The
flames had rolled to the rim of the meadowland,
and the valley seemed edged with a wall of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the court below a grim fight had begun.
The madmen who had broken loose from their
vaults had fallen upon old Nicholas and the two
soldiers, penned them in a corner by the gate. The
three were overpowered by the furious many,
beaten down, trampled, torn limb from limb.
Then, in the unreasoning madness of their
triumph, the mob had broken down the great gate,
and opened the house to the beasts of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment the wolves, scenting blood, came
padding in, leaping on each other in the narrow
entry. A hundred red-eyed things surged into
the court, foam dropping from their white-fanged
snouts. The place became as a pagan amphitheatre,
full of death and immeasurable horror.
While the fire devoured the trees of the forest, the
madman and the wolf rent and slew each other.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Through the black and ruined land came Tristan
and his men, marching where the rivers ran, that
they might not tread ankle deep in ashes, nor be
choked and blinded by the dust and smoke. Ruin
was everywhere, black, saturnine, and solemn. A
strange silence hung upon the world, where the
charred trees still stood with their hands outstretched
to the rainless sky. Many lay fallen like
the dead upon a battlefield. The wind had passed,
the storm blasts moaned no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Tristan rode through the desolate woods, he
bowed down his head, and was heavy of heart.
He had loved these children of the forest, these
scorched martyrs stricken in the rising of the sap.
No more would their banners blow with the march
of spring. And yet the dead trees were but outlined
against the deeper gold of memory, a melancholy
afterglow, weird yet tender. The savage in
him was inert awhile. Childhood and youth came
back, his mother’s face and Rosamunde’s sad eyes,
the golden glimmer of his sister’s hair. Rosamunde,
Rosamunde! What of the red rose
plucked from the snowy towers of Joyous Vale?
For the moment he forgot the grim, grinding
present, the ten thousand iron men who drove
clouds of dust from the ashes under their horses’
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards evening they saw a river gleaming
below them in a valley, shining like silver set in
ebony, as it coursed through the blackened country.
Tristan, drawing rein with the Duchess upon
the brow of a hill, hardly knew the valley, so great
was the change the flames had worked. The river
parted about an island, foaming over the rocks
that thrust their black snouts above the surface.
The island itself was green and untouched, girded
by the water from the dead wild around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan pointed Blanche and his captains to it
with his sword. There was a strange light upon
his face, even as the light upon the face of a
crusader who beheld the Holy City shining under
the blue arch of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold Jocelyn’s hermitage,” he said to them.
“Columbe my sister lies buried under yonder
cedar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche, weary despite the strength of her
strenuous soul, strove to calm for the moment the
passion of a man who had lived as in a furnace
those many months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she answered him, with a hand on
his bridle, “is it not enough that you have conquered?
Shall not your sister rest in peace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expression of the man’s face changed again
as suddenly as the surface of a darkened mirror.
The old fanatical and sullen gloom rushed back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is victory,” he said, “but the power to
punish, to crush the adder under the heel. My
sister shall rest in no hidden grave. By my soul,
I have sworn it; in Agravale I will build her
tomb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There could be no debate with such a man as
this, whose spirit flamed like a torch in a wind.
Tristan dismounted on the brow of the hill, bade
them bring forward the wooden coffin that had
carried Jocelyn from the town of Marvail. The
blazoned banner covered the shell. Tristan, with
his own hands, flung the “Golden Keys” aside,
ungirded the lid, bade his men lift the Bishop out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn stood there, a lean, cringing figure, with
the pride gone from his hollow-cheeked face. His
eyes roved over the blackened country, the sepulchral
trees, the brown, scorched grass. He seemed
dizzy in the sun, looking more like some starved
ascetic than the plump prelate who had ruled
Agravale. Tristan ordered wine to be brought,
and Jocelyn drank greedily from the flask, his
head shaking as with an old man’s palsy. The
red wine ran down his chin, stained his tunic,
soaked the dead grass at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood above him with drawn sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seest thou yonder island?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn followed with his eyes the pointing
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder,” said the knight, “yonder is your
forest hermitage, Bishop, where Pandart kept
house for those whom you cherished. Stir your
wits, man; is your memory so slow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn winced; his lip quivered; there was a
moist mist over his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God judge me, I know not the place,” he said.
“Your words are meaningless, sinner that I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Tristan’s sword touched the Bishop’s
shoulder; the man squirmed under it like a frightened
dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ogier is no name to you? Come, priest, look
into my eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ogier, by God’s light, I know no such
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor Rosamunde, Lady of Joyous Vale, nor
even Columbe whom ye did to death? Lie not to
me, Jocelyn of Agravale, for you know my face; I
am that Tristan who served in your guard. It was
I who slew Ogier in yonder woods, and set the
Lady Rosamunde safe in Holy Guard. It is my
sister who lies dead under yonder cedar. Tell me,
by God, whether you deserve not death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jocelyn bowed his shoulders beneath the words
as a slave stoops from the hissing lash. He
clutched his bosom, choked, fell prone, grovelled
at Tristan’s feet. But in Tristan’s heart there was
no glimmer of pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strip him, sirs,” were his words to his men.
“When ye have scourged him down to the island,
set him in his priest’s robes by my sister’s grave.
Guard him there till I shall come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samson’s old followers broke their ranks,
stripped Jocelyn naked, unbuckled their belts, and
drove him down towards the river. Whimpering,
grovelling, he took his chastisement, spurned and
scorned, the creature of Fate. They dragged him
over the rocks in the bed of the river, robed him
in the state robes they had taken from his tent, and
bound him to the cedar tree in the garden. Such
was the pilgrimage he made that day to the grave
of Columbe, Tristan’s sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not till evening had come did Tristan enter
upon the fulfilling of the vow that he had sworn
before Rosamunde over Columbe’s grave. His
men were camped about the island and under the
branches of the spectral trees. The west was an
open gate of gold, the dead forest wreathed in
rivers of mist. The island, with the dark foliage
of its trees and shrubs, lay like some dusky emerald
sewn on the bosom of a sable robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche the Duchess’s pavilion had been
pitched on the stretch of grass before the house.
Tristan had sought solitude in the room where
Rosamunde had been lodged in the summer months
that were gone. He passed an hour alone in that
chamber, pacing from wall to wall, thinking of the
task that lay before him. Never did his heart
flinch more than from that ordeal of death, the
opening of his sister’s grave. He had searched the
room, and had discovered in a cupboard an old robe
of Rosamunde’s, even the very one she had worn
the night the Papists ravaged Ronan’s town. Tristan
took it, pressed the hem to his lips. The robe
should cover Columbe’s body, love’s robe for a lost
love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night came, and torches were kindled. Tristan,
stern and white of face, knelt down and prayed,
and passed out from the house. In her pavilion
he found Blanche seated in state, her coronet
circling her silvery hair, her knights round her as
for some solemn council. The garden was
thronged with armed men, their helmets gleaming
in the light of the torches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood alone before the Duchess’s tent,
and bent the knee to her as one who serves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, in the hearing of all, “I
go to uncover my sister’s grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Tristan,” she answered him with steady
voice, “God comfort you in this your hour of
trial. We would not gape nor gaze on your grief.
Sirs, stand by me; let no man move save Sir Tristan
gives him word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light in the west still wavered through the
gloom. To the north rose the dome of the great
cedar, its green boughs sweeping even to the
ground. It stood like a green temple built by
Nature for the kindly shading of a woodland grave.
Tristan kissed the Duchess’s hand, and chose ten
of Samson’s men who had served him of old in the
Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hid by the cypresses that closed the hollow,
they passed with two torches under the cedar. By
the dark trunk stood Jocelyn of Agravale, clad in
his pontificals as Tristan had ordered. The men
went to work on the grass mound. Near by lay
the two coffins side by side, the Banner of the
Golden Keys covering the larger. While five men
opened Columbe’s grave, the rest dug a fresh
trench under the cedar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood by the mound and watched their
labours, the torchlight playing upon his face,
wreathing grim shadows about his figure. There
was a terrible calm in the eyes that never wavered
under the arch of the casque. Soon the soiled fold
of a gown came to light, then a little hand, frail
and wasted. Soon they had taken Columbe from
the grave, after covering the face that Tristan
might not see it. The man shaded his eyes with
his great forearm as they laid the body in the
coffin, and bade one of the soldiers cut from her
head a long lock of her golden hair. Soiled with
earth as it was, he laid the lock upon his lips,
knotted it with hand and teeth about his arm. He
had taken the silver snake from off his wrist and
tossed the bracelet into the coffin, which he bade
the men cover with Rosamunde’s robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not one of those who laboured had spoken. In
silence the whole host stood to arms as the moon
came up over the blackened hills. Yet when
Columbe was borne from under the cedar, a hundred
trumpets challenged the night, their wild
clamour echoing amid the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the second grave lay deep under the
tree, Tristan, striding to the trunk of the cedar,
ordered the torches to be brought near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bishop,” he said, “chant your own death
Mass, even a Mass for her whom Ogier slew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No mercy did they show to Jocelyn that night.
When they had made an end, they laid him in the
coffin, covered it with the Sacred Banner, and
lowered the whole into the open grave.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When Tristan had kept the vow he had sworn in
the past over Columbe’s grave, he was as a man
who had battled at night through a stormy sea, to
behold once more the calm and broadening splendour
of the dawn. Jocelyn his arch-enemy was
dead. The clouds had lightened about Tristan’s
soul; his heart hungered for Rosamunde, and for
that golden head bowed down beneath the pathos
of the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan rose at daybreak and took leave of
Blanche, who walked early in the island garden.
There was a sadness on the woman’s face, the noble
fortitude of one whose heart was hungry and whose
dreams were dead. Yet she could play the mother
to Tristan in his love, even as a good woman who
imprisons herself seeks joy in the joy of others, contentment
in their content. Her eyes grew full of
light as Tristan came to her and commended
Columbe’s body to her care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God-speed ye, Tristan,” she said, with her
deep voice, “in the good quest that fires your heart
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he answered, ignorant of her full
sacrifice, “the night that Samson’s death was told
us in the wilds, did I not show you all that my
heart held sacred? We have avenged him and my
sister here. By your good grace, and my great
gratitude, we meet again before the walls of Agravale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” she said, stretching out her hand,
“may your quest prosper. As for a grandam like
myself, I regain my youth in the youth of others.
Your little ones shall clamber at my knees anon;
her children, shall I not love them for their
father’s sake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Tristan took his leave of her, and rode
for the Mad Mere with a hundred men. Rosamunde,
Rosamunde, Rosamunde! Spring was
in the wind, though the blackened forest would
spread no more its green canopies against the
moonlight. All the old memories awoke in
Tristan’s heart with a great uprushing of tenderness.
He remembered Rosamunde in a hundred
scenes: moving through Ronan’s town with the
children at her heels, bending to kiss him in her
castle bower, sleeping in the woods on the way
to Holy Guard. Her deep eyes haunted him; her
rich voice pealed through all the avenues of
thought. Tristan’s heart rejoiced in its passionate
and rekindled youth. He prayed to God that he
might look on Rosamunde’s face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode at the head of his men that day with
a fine light playing in his deep-set eyes. His very
soul seemed enhaloed about his face; his voice
rang clear as a trumpet cry as he gave his orders
and cheered on his men. As the reeking ashes
smoked under their horses’ hoofs, the bronzed
veterans jested together, bartered their rough
gibes, caught their captain’s spirit. They loved
Tristan for his fiery strength, his huge activity,
his undaunted zeal. The story of the Lady of
Joyous Vale had gone round the camp fires on
many a night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was guided by the distant hills, for he
had noted their shape that summer day when he
rode with Ogier to the Forest Hermitage. To the
south, gaunt crags rose above the trees, three
towering pinnacles, huge, natural obelisks cleaving
the blue. Tristan kept to the higher ground. It
was well past noon before he saw water glimmering
in a blackened hollow, the island swimming
fresh and green in the glassy waters of the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great silence wrapped the valley, and there
was no smoke rising from the house, no boat
moving over the lake. The ruinous woods were
dark and still. Yet as they rode down through
the trees, Tristan’s man, a youth whose kinsfolk
had been slain in the province of the Seven
Streams, held up a hand, with a warning cry. A
long, low howl came pealing over the water, a
note in keeping with the desolation of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, a wolf’s howl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan drew rein, and scanned the island under
his hand. A swift shadow had fallen upon his
face, wiping out the radiance, dimming the light
in the eyes. His men halted around him, their
spears towards the sky, their shields shining in
the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, look yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brown thing trotted out from a small thicket
on the island, stopped with nose in air with one
paw up, and broke into a wild howling that woke
the hills. Wolves, brown and grey, came hustling
out from the yawn of the great gate. They cast
about from side to side, snarling and snapping at
each other, filling the valley with their uncouth
clamour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wolves, in truth,” said Tristan, looking grim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his bridle and, shouting to his men,
cantered off over the scorched meadowland towards
the water. The brutes upon the island, catching
sight of him, gave tongue more fiercely, and
howled in chorus. Tristan’s horse pricked up its
ears, snorted, swerved, and would not go forward.
He slipped out of the saddle, and, stopping his
men with uplifted sword, bade them tether their
horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed down to the mere on foot, and
took counsel there, for old Nicholas’s boat was
moored fast by the wooden stage that ran out from
the island into the water. Tristan’s eyes searched
the silent house. Of a sudden he pointed with
his sword to a window overlooking the garden,
where a white cloth waved under the red tiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What boots it to tell how Tristan swam the
mere, and brought back the boat over the water?
It was sword and spear for the brown beasts of
the forest. Only when Tristan’s men entered the
great gate did the unhallowed horror of the place
give them the challenge. A few wolves still lurked
amid the dead, the shredded relics of that night
of slaughter. Tristan had the gates clapped to
after they had put these last beasts to the sword,
for fire alone could purge such a charnel house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wall of the garden there was a little
postern, its lock and bolts glued by the rust of
years. Tristan broke the gate down with an axe,
and, pushing in over the broken wood, found the
garden within calm and green, unsullied by death
or by the beasts of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His men had remained without the gate,
prompted by a rough chivalry that gave Tristan
honour. On the top step of the stair that led from
the upper room stood a woman clad in a black
robe, her hair loose upon her shoulders. There
were deep shadows under her eyes, and her face
was white as the face of the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stood at the foot of the stairway with
the axe still gripped in his great brown hands. It
was not the Tristan who had served of old, but
rather a man whose neck was stubborn, a man
whose pride would suffer no yoke. The eyes that
searched the woman’s face were sterner than those
she had known of yore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said to her almost roughly,
“you are free once more to go where you will.
By God’s good providence, I have cheated death
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swayed a little where she stood as she
looked down on him and watched his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ever your debtor,” she said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I claim no usury,” he answered her, with a
queer smile; “what is duty to me comes as a mere
command.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you no better words for me than these?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swayed forward suddenly, and Tristan saw
that she was faint. He threw down the axe,
sprang up the stairway, and stretched out his
hands to her with sudden pity. Hunger and fear
had done their work. He bore her back like a
child into the room, and laid her on the bed where
Miriam the Jewess knelt in prayer. Then, going
out, he left the women alone together.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A strange yet beautiful timidity had fallen upon
Rosamunde when Tristan next darkened the doorway
of the room. He had left her to Miriam’s
care, and, after sending in wine and food from his
sumpter mules, had contented himself with giving
the hapless dead fit burial. With Telamon, his
man, at his heels, he had passed through all the
vaults, chambers, and galleries of the place, that
he might rest assured that no starving wretches
were left therein. In one damp cell he found an
old man dead. Between them they carried him
out into the sun, buried him apart from the grim
gatherings of the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the west grew red over the hills, Tristan
passed alone into the garden and climbed the stairway
to Rosamunde’s room. The Lady of Joyous
Vale was seated on a carved oak settle, her hair
uncoifed, falling in rich folds upon her neck. The
strange timidity upon her face was the more
eloquent by reason of her old-time pride. Miriam
crept out and left the two together; in the garden
she found Telamon, and since the youth coloured
when she spoke to him, she was not afraid of
letting her eyes grow bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan le Sauvage stood before Rosamunde, a
great tenderness lighting his gaunt face so that it
seemed transfigured in the woman’s eyes. It was
not the Tristan she had known of old, the sullen
and over-strenuous boy, who blushed and stammered
with his tongue. The man who stood before
her was in his mighty prime, terrible in wrath,
tender to weak things, fearless as a god. This
Tristan had passed through deep waters, had faced
death and defeated despair. The soul in him was
greater than of yore, even because he had known
sorrow and climbed to the summit of a more tragic
strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde, pale, penitent, discovered the
great parable of life eloquent against herself. It
was she who had ruled Tristan in the days that
had passed away. Love and the deep passion-throes
of life had changed the charm, strengthening
the man, mellowing the woman. She conceived
strange awe of Tristan as she gazed on his
face that night, and saw the deep lines sorrow
and pain had marked thereon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half timidly she beckoned him to the carved
bench, even with the shyness of one who was half
ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “we are more silent than
of old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed sunk in thought for the
moment as he gazed upon her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We learn to be silent,” he answered her, “by
reason of the rough realities of life. Am I the
rude boy, Rosamunde, whom you pitied and
helped of yore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She coloured, and her eyes grew deep with
shadows. There was some bitterness in Tristan’s
voice, even as though the memory of her own
mere pity still weighed upon his soul. She grew
meek before him with a simplicity that surprised
even her own heart. In the old days her pride
would have tinged her lips with scorn. Yet now
that love had come and opened her whole heart,
the petty prides of life had shrivelled and decayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “God knows, you are
much changed to me. Sit here beside me. Must
I then ask you twice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan obeyed her in silence, resting one great
arm on the carved back of the settle. The two
were half turned towards each other, casting
questioning glances into each other’s eyes; for as
yet neither had fathomed the depths of the other’s
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Rosamunde who first set pride aside
with much of the innocence of a little child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, with the look of one whose
heart beat hurriedly, “am I to be forgiven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgiven!” he echoed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the ingratitude I gave to you of old. I
was a proud fool in those dead days. Tristan,
I am wiser now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught a deep breath, bent slightly towards
her, gazing in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember no ingratitude,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot cheat me into loving my old self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He still looked into her eyes, doubtingly, like a
man half disbelieving a dawning truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said, “in those days I was
but a rough and impetuous boy. God knows, I
served you, even as a rude soldier would have
served one throned above him in the hearts of
many. What then was Tristan, that he should
lift his eyes to yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She coloured and bowed down her head. Her
hands were folded upon her bosom; she swayed
slightly, even as a woman needing the strength
of a strong man’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Tristan,” she said, stammering over the
words, “the fault was mine, and I, proud fool,
have learnt my lesson. All the horror and heaviness
of life have made me wise. What was Rosamunde
that she should refuse a heart of gold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stretched out a hand, stooped, and
looked into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I not seen misery enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truth, the truth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before God, Tristan, take and guard me from
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands held hers; she crept close to him,
and hid her face upon his shoulder. Her bright
hair bathed his face; his great arms compassed
her, drew fast about her body. Presently she
lifted up her face to his, a dim glory thereon, her
eyes swimming with unshed tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kiss me, Tristan,” she said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched her lips with his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last—peace,” she said, with a great sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace,” he answered her, as though his whole
manhood stooped over her in prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did Tristan of Purple Isle win Rosamunde
for his lady, after much pain and peril,
travail and grim endeavour. A good sword and
a stout heart had won him knighthood in strange
lands, honour of all men, and the gold crown of
love. To Tristan and Rosamunde their joy was
full, tinged with the strangeness that breathes in
all beauty, either in faith or desire, or in the
mysterious deeps of Nature. Perhaps the woman
was happier than the man, in that sorrow burdened
him, and in the lightening of such sorrow lay a
woman’s gladness. That night in the madhouse
they talked much of Columbe and of Samson the
Heretic. The dear dead were with them in the full
life of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morrow, a golden morrow, they took
horse for Agravale, Rosamunde riding on a white
mule that Tristan had taken at Marvail. Young
Telamon bore Miriam behind him on his horse;
the flaxen poll and the black curls were well
accorded. Tristan and Rosamunde watched the
by-play, riding close together and smiling into
each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was past noon before they saw the far towers
of Agravale smite athwart the tranquil blue. Once
more the woods were green and generous, for the
fire had been stayed by the broad valleys that
clove deep into the dusky woods. At a roadside
cross Tristan fell in with a company of the
Duchess’s men who were on the watch for him at
the edge of the forest. They had staunch news for
Tristan, the last triumph-cry of the heretics’ war,
for but yesterday Lothaire had surprised Benedict
of the Mountains in the open land to the west of
Agravale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Black Benedict and the southern barons, flying
before the forest fire, had retreated on Agravale to
throw themselves therein. Lothaire, coming up
by forced marches from the west, had thrust himself
between the southrons and the city. There
had been a fierce battle of horse on the outskirts
of the forest. In the midst of the tussle Blanche
and her columns had plunged upon the scene and
turned the battle into a rout. Benedict and the
great part of his ruffians had been hemmed in and
slain fighting to a finish amid the glooms of the
forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Tristan and his company came
from the woods, and saw before the walls of Agravale
all the chivalry of the north and of the Seven
Streams ranged under arms in the meadows about
the banner of the Duchess. In the centre, raised
upon a mound of earth, stood Columbe’s coffin,
covered with purple cloth. Beyond the thousand
spears the towers and battlements of Agravale
gleamed white above the woods. Far to the south
the great mountains stood, purple and gold,
coroneted with snow, crimsoned by the setting
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening before the walls of Agravale
Blanche rode down alone on her great white horse
to greet Tristan and Rosamunde the Lady of Joyous
Vale. The Duchess had tuned her heart to
a noble strain. Setting pride and passion behind
her back, she rode down like the splendid woman
that she was, to rejoice with those whose hearts
were glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Rosamunde dismounted before her,
went to her like children, hand in hand, two
pilgrims who had knelt at a common shrine.
Blanche descended from off her horse, Tristan
holding the stirrup, giving her his hand. He did
not guess how heavy was her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old friend,” she said, smiling half sadly in
his face, “is not your joy mine, though my hair
is grey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to Rosamunde, held her hands, kissed
her upon the forehead, as though she had been
her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” she said, “God has blessed thee in
this. A good man’s love is worth much travail.
Has he not come through much peril towards your
face? For when the heart is noble the truth comes
first.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XXXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess Lilias, white sinner that she was,
had fled from Agravale and taken horse for the
East Lands with all her men. Great fear had
seized upon those in the city when the northern
sky had gleamed with the fringes of the fire.
Under cover of night they had fled in a panic out
of Agravale, men, women, and children, the monk
and the merchant, the great lady and the hag.
Unreasoning fear had seized on every heart, for
they remembered the sacking of Ronan’s town,
and the foul deeds done by their soldiery in the
province of the Seven Streams. Rumour had
mouthed the report in Agravale that the heretics
and the men of the north would sack the city in
revenge for the harrying of the Seven Streams.
When news was brought of Benedict’s overthrow,
there was much wailing through all the city. In
their panic the whole population fled out of Agravale,
after gathering such valuables as they could
carry—gold cups, precious stones, money bags,
bales of silk. Many of the aged and the sick were
left within the walls, abandoned in the fierce terror
of the moment. As for the priests, they were the
first to be gone, having a jealous reverence for the
ecclesiastical sanctity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus when Blanche’s trumpets rang out before
the walls there came no shrill counterblast, no
bristling up of spears. They seemed to challenge
a city of the dead, white and voiceless, sunk in the
mystery of the solemn woods. The gates were
open, the streets silent, the towers and battlements
devoid of life. There was no brave clamour to tell
of courage, no clangour of bells, no blowing of
trumpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lothaire and his captains had suspected
treachery at first, some subtle trap or priestly
ambush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tread warily, madame,” he said to his
lady. “Who knows what devilry lurks in such
silence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cautious even in victory, they sent advance
guards into the city, not only to hold the gates,
but to search places, churches and abbeys, where
armed men might lie in hiding. Company after
company had clattered in, with no sound to greet
them save the clangour of their horses’ hoofs. The
streets were silent, the houses empty, the church
gates open, the gardens deserted. In St. Pelinore’s
they had found a few infirm folk who had taken
sanctuary before the altar, while the very dogs
seemed to have fled the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus when Tristan and Rosamunde came from
the Mad Mere with their hundred men, Agravale
of the south was in Blanche’s hands. She had
quartered her men within the walls, but had made
no state entry into the city. Nor had she suffered
Columbe’s coffin to be taken in, remembering her
promise to Tristan in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morrow after Tristan’s joining the
Duchess, they marched into Agravale with banners
flying, trumpets pealing through the empty
streets. Eight men of Samson’s company carried
Columbe’s coffin upon their shoulders, Tristan
walking bareheaded behind the body, with Blanche
and Rosamunde following at his heels. After
them came the Duchess’s knights, their shields
covered, their swords reversed. Yet Tristan had
ordered the bells to be rung, the trumpets to be
blown as though for a victory. Had he not taken
Columbe from her grave of shame to tomb her
royally within the walls of Agravale?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus with bell a-swing, arms clanging, trumpets
screaming, they came through the wide and
splendid streets to the great church of St. Pelinore.
On either hand rose the rich houses of white stone,
and the broad gardens brimming with early
flowers. At the gate of the church Tristan stood
aside with drawn sword, suffered Blanche and
Rosamunde to pass in before him. Above shone
the painted roof, on either side the tall bejewelled
windows, panels of colour let into the grey wall.
Columbe’s coffin was carried up the aisle, into the
choir, past the carved stalls to where the high altar
shone with alabaster and gold. Tristan mounted
the seven steps, turned and faced the knights and
the rough soldiery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirs,” he said, bending his head towards the
Duchess, “by God’s grace, and this good lady’s
nobleness, we are masters of Agravale and of the
Southern Marches. Yonder lies Columbe of
Purple Isle, even my sister, whom Jocelyn slew by
Ogier’s sword. By your good grace I will bury
her here, even under the high altar of the southern
saint, Pelinore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole church cheered him, smote their
shields, the thunder of the voices beating upon the
roof. Many of the men who had followed Tristan
and Samson ran to the outbuildings where tools
were stored, came back bearing picks and bars of
iron. Tristan pointed them to the altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Break down this table for me,” he cried, with
upraised sword. “Carve me a grave that will hold
my sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence fell upon the mass of steel-capped heads
that filled the church from wall to wall. Desecration—but
what of that? Was a broken grave
worse than an outraged hearth, than homeless
women or murdered men? Soon came the sharp
clangour of pick and bar as Tristan’s soldiers
broke the altar. Alabaster and marble, gold work
and precious stones came crumbling down the
whitened steps, till the altar became a ruinous
heap, its pomp a pile of dust and rubble, glistening
with gold work and gleaming gems. Beneath
four great flagstones that the men had laid bare
was tombed the body of St. Pelinore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under these stones they came upon a leaden
coffin, with a cross of tarnished gold riveted
thereon. In the grave were a staff, a pair of
sandals, and a faded robe. For the moment the
men recoiled from the coffin and the relics of a
saint. Tristan, seeing their moral quandary,
sprang over the pile of rubbish into the grave
and touched the leaden coffin with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of Holy Guard, Sir Saint?” he said.
“Thou who persecutest in visions, rise up and
prove thy power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sound came from the silence save the heavy
breathing of the men who had broken down the
altar. Tristan stood back from the grave, smiled
at the mute faces of his men, pointed them to the
coffin with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have broken the spell, sirs,” he said. “This
good saint will not save his church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took heart and obeyed him, lifted the
coffin out, laid it in the choir betwixt the stalls
where Samson’s heretics were gathered. Into the
grave they lowered Columbe’s body, replaced the
stones, piled back at Tristan’s bidding the broken
fragments of the altar. Only Blanche and Rosamunde
remained while Tristan knelt there awhile
and prayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he arose they both came to him, like
Hope and Charity who had attended at the burial
of Faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God give you joy, Tristan,” said the Duchess.
“Columbe is avenged. Turn now, let all dark
thoughts elapse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at them both and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night is past,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche had taken Rosamunde by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here, oh my brother, is your dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out into the sunny forecourt where
the men were burying the coffin of St. Pelinore
under an orange tree. Once more the great church
was steeped in solitude, the sunlight plashing
through the coloured glass, the arches wreathed
with shadowy gloom. Yet the rosary with its
stones of white and green would be trodden no
more by the penitents of Agravale. An Isaurian
spirit had inspired Tristan towards the church, yet
he was no mere image-breaker in his victory. The
great church of St. Pelinore should cover with its
ruins the grave of Columbe, his dead sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the great work began. Knight and
soldier seized an axe and pick, broke down the
altars and images and the rich frescoes. They
threw down the buttresses, sapped the piers and
pillars at their foundations, breached the walls and
mined them in many places. By sunset the whole
church tottered, the great tower trembled, the
pillars fell. It was then that they fastened twenty
stout ropes about the knees of the great central
piers. Every man quitted the doomed church and
ran out to watch its final overthrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the flash of Tristan’s sword the men in the
square set their hands to the ropes and drew together
with a loud shout. The two southern piers,
sapped at their foundations, tottered, broke, and
came down like thunder. For a moment the tall
tower quivered and stood. Then came the rending
of the walls, the heavy downrush of the roof.
Pillars crashed down like smitten Titans; a cloud
of dust rushed to the heavens. Even as the temple
of the Philistines fell beneath Samson’s strength,
so the church of St. Pelinore sank in ruins over
Columbe’s grave.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XL</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>About the White Palace far south of the Great
Mountains were pitched a thousand tents, some
under the shadows of the wooded heights, others
on the banks of a broad river. The palace stood
on a hill in the midst of a valley, like a white
casket wonderfully carved set upon a pedestal of
green marble. In its gardens fountains played
amid groves of roses, myrtles, and orange trees.
Huge cypresses rose against the gleaming walls,
overshadowing beds of purple flowers, white
marble stairways, tranquil pools. Towards the deep
blue dome of the sky, tower, turret, and minaret
mimicked the white peaks of the distant mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the White Palace on its hill were gathered
the armies of Serjabil the Caliph. Pious Moslem
that he was, a turbulent man with a heart of fire,
he had sent a letter through all his caliphate to
such as served Allah and loved the Crescent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of the most merciful God, Serjabil
to all true believers, joy and greatness be
upon you. By the most high God and Mohammed
his Prophet, this is to declare that I would send
our arms against the infidels who have fallen upon
each other beyond the mountains. For behold
fighting for the truth is obedience to God. Therefore
gather to me, children of the faith, with bow
and spear, buckler and scimitar, that we may
destroy the infidels, and beat down the Cross into
the dust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the great Hall of the Ambassadors sat Serjabil
in his ivory chair, a hundred carved pillars
dwindling around into the golden gloom of the
deepening eve. The ceiling of the hall was of
cedar wood, inlaid with silver and lapis lazuli.
The walls were covered with tiles of azure and
green; the pillars and arches decorated with arabesques
and letters of beaten gold. The floor was
of white marble, the hangings of scarlet silk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Serjabil wore a green turban enriched with
rubies. His red robe was edged with rare fur over
a tunic that was white as the marble floor. In his
belt shone a jewelled scimitar, and before him on
a desk of cedar wood was laid the Koran—the book
of the Prophet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Serjabil’s black eyes gleamed and sparkled in
his dusky face. It was the face of a man who was
both a soldier and a sage, one who possessed the
heart of a Kaled and the wisdom of an Ali knit
together. About him were gathered the great
ones of his land, emirs with snow-white beards,
merchant princes, soldiers, scribes. They were
gathered there in Serjabil’s palace to hear his commands
concerning the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Serjabil’s chair stood Hassan the poet,
a thin-featured man, with a short black beard.
The Caliph had called him forth from the throng
to utter panegyrics in praise of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh Hassan,” were the Caliph’s words, “to
what would you liken the servant of God who
destroyeth the heathen and obeyeth the Prophet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poet salaamed, and touched with his lips
a little charm that he wore at his neck on a silver
chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh Lion of God,” quoth he, stretching out his
hands, “who shall dare to praise the great? Behold,
have I not seen the sun in his strength roll
back the mists out of the valleys and launch his
chariots over the hills? The hearts of the holy
hunger for battle, for the sound of the sword and
the cry of the trumpet. To the sun would I liken
the Lion of God, who giveth life to the children of
men, even life in death, and in death paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Serjabil took a brooch from his red robe, a
brooch set with precious stones, and cast it on the
floor at Hassan’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh son of the golden mouth,” he said, “God
give ye joy of the true belief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hassan bowed low and took the brooch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Methinks,” he cried, with his face afire, “that
I see the black-eyed girls of heaven gazing upon
us from their scented gardens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a sign from Serjabil two black slaves brought
a man in shackles from a neighbouring alcove. It
was Thibaut the Apostate, a renegade priest, who
had fled from Agravale over the mountains. He
had received many wrongs at Jocelyn’s hands, and
in his shame he had abjured the Cross, and turned
Mohammedan to serve his ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing before Serjabil’s chair, with the huge
Æthiopians towering above him, Thibaut told of
the state of the Christian provinces, and of the
turbulence and vanity that reigned therein. He
told how Samson had arisen in the Seven Streams,
and had spread his heresy among the people till
the Pope had decreed a crusade against him and
the barons of the south had marched to war.
Thibaut described the lands north of the mountains
as empty and ruinous, rotten with decay.
The Cross had been carried against the Cross, so
that the Christians had sapped each other’s
strength. The Southern Marches, ay, and the
Seven Streams, waited for the conqueror who
should come with the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Thibaut had spoken, Serjabil arose and
laid his hand on the open Koran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of God,” he said, “and of
Mohammed His Prophet, shall we not march
against these fools? Behold, we are strong, we
are not divided. While these Christians quarrel,
let us cross the mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many dark eyes kindled at the words; hands
were stretched towards the Sacred Book, swords
drawn and held towards the cedarn roof. The
dusky faces shone with zeal, and white teeth
gleamed behind coal-black beards. Serjabil drew
his scimitar from its sheath, kissed the naked
blade whereon were carved texts from the Koran
and the names of his ancestors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La illah il Allah,” cried they all with the dim,
strange ardour of the East, “let us march, oh Lion,
against the Cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then through the shadowy galleries, under the
dreamy arches, came the cry of a muezzin from the
minaret in the great court—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To prayer, to prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it was the hour before sunset, when the hills
were red above the cypress thickets and the golden
meads. Silence had fallen in the hall where black
slaves knelt with bowls full of water under the blue
and silver roof. The solemn worshippers cleansed
themselves, washing face, hands, and neck before
falling to prayer. Every turbaned head was bowed
towards the east, while the prayers went up through
the many arches into the gold of the evening sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Serjabil rose from off his knees, he closed
the Koran upon its stand of cedar wood, and
passed out to the stone-paved terrace that looked
over the valley towards the woods. Beneath lay
the palace garden, its dark thickets steeped in the
odour of a myriad flowers. Soldiers and scribes
followed the Caliph, their many-coloured turbans
like a rich parterre against the whiteness of the
palace walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath in the valley stood the tents of Serjabil’s
camp. The Saracens had risen from the
grass where they had knelt in prayer, their faces
towards the east. Seeing the Caliph upon the
walls, they raised a loud shout, stretched up their
hands to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La illah il Allah,” came the cry, “oh Lion of
Heaven, the Prophet preserve thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many ran to where their horses were tethered,
loosed them, mounted, and took spear and shield.
They galloped and circled over the meadows, tossing
their lances high in the air, making mimic
onslaughts, troop against troop. Their wild cries
rang over rock and river as the sun went down into
the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Serjabil stood close by the parapet with Thibaut
the Apostate by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold,” he cried to those around him, “how
the crescent moon climbs into the sky. She shall
shine full on us that night when we cross the
mountains.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was still at Agravale with some two hundred
men, when a mob of peasant folk came into
the city, bringing with them a lean, half-starved
southron who had fled to Agravale over the mountains.
The man had served as a slave in Serjabil’s
palace, and being wise as to the Caliph’s schemes
of conquest, he had dared martyrdom and fled for
the north. Two other Christians who had shared
his flight had been taken and beheaded on the road.
The third had gained the mountains in safety, and
having crossed by the pass known as St. Isidore’s
Gate, had descended into the lowlands with the cry
of a prophet—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fly, for the Saracens are at my heels!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but two days since Blanche’s men had
marched from Agravale, glad to return home
through the Seven Streams after their campaigning
in the south. The Duchess had tarried one
day more, leaving Tristan and Rosamunde to
guard the rear as they marched north towards the
fords of the Lorient. At Agravale she had received
an embassage from the King stating that he was
coming south with his barons to restore peace to
the Southern Marches. He besought her to meet
him at a certain border town that they might
discuss the state of the Seven Streams. And since
Blanche had no great belief in the King’s honour,
nor in the sincerity of his faith, she had determined
to meet him at the head of her men, the most powerful
plea for peace and justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evening when the news came to Tristan
as he was preparing to evacuate Agravale on the
morrow and follow Blanche towards the north. He
had but two hundred men left in the city, mostly
Samson’s veterans from the Seven Streams. The
country folk crowded round him as he came out
upon the steps of Lilias’s palace, and besought him
not to desert them in their extremity, and to leave
their farms and hamlets at the mercy of the
Saracens. Tristan pointed out to the chief
pleader the smallness of his company, reminded
them that they had little cause to claim protection
at his hands. But when some of the rough men
wept, and besought him the more to save their
homes and families from the sword, pointing out
that St. Isidore’s Gate might be held by a hundred
resolute men, he told them he would consider the
matter, and give them an answer before dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Tristan went alone into Lilias’s
garden and paced to and fro through the tangled
grass. He was tempted greatly to abandon the
south, for he had fought his fill since he had sailed
from Purple Isle and landed in the heart of the
Seven Streams. He had met grief and conquered
it, and found love at last after many days. He
was as a man who had grown weary of the chaos
of war and hungered for God’s peace, and the clear
calm of a woman’s love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about Rosamunde’s face that Tristan’s
passions played as he walked in Lilias’s garden
under the moon. Should he gamble once more
with fate, stake that which he had won with his
own good sword, when the future stretched clear
as a summer dawn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had not the lords of the Southern Marches
harried the province of the Seven Streams and
carried death and despair into a thousand homes?
What claims had these people upon his pity?
Could it be that God had decreed their destruction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the temptation that assailed Tristan
that night to take Rosamunde his love and to ride
from Agravale, leaving the Southern Marches to
their fate. He could overtake the Duchess in a
day, and leave the future to her and the King. If
Serjabil and his Saracens crossed the mountains,
the King could gather his great vassals and give
them battle in due season. Had he not done
enough with his single sword?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as great hearts rise to great needs, so Tristan
cast the tempter out of his soul, and grew
strong in the strength of heroic manhood. The
shade of Samson seemed to walk at his side, Samson
who had been crucified for Christ and the
Cross, and who had met death, a living sacrifice.
Should he not save these helpless peasant folk from
the Saracen scimitars and the false creed of their
Prophet? He would stand shamed before God
when the villages flamed and the smoke of their
burning ascended to heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan knelt down in the grass and prayed,
with the deserted city silent under the moon and
the great stars shining overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord Jesus,” he said, “I pray Thee pardon
these weak thoughts that rose in my heart against
my manhood and Thee. Grant me Thy grace to
this good end that I may save these helpless ones
who have sought my sword. Give me Thy
strength against the heathen that I may quit
myself as a Christian should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight he went out from Lilias’s garden
to the great hall where his men were gathered.
Some were asleep on the rush-strewn floor, others
were watching and talking together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirs,” he said, “how many will stand with
me for the Holy Cross, and hold the passes till
the Duchess comes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every hand was stretched towards him; nor did
they fail him, these iron men, who had followed
Samson through the Seven Streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you all!” he cried, with a smile
on his face. “Percival, take horse and ride after
the Duchess. Tell her the Saracens are marching
for the mountains, that we go to hold St. Isidore’s
Gate. Ride, man, as though the devil rode at
your heels. The Duchess will turn and give us
succour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the dawn came the great trial of Tristan’s
strength, for Rosamunde was ignorant of what had
passed, and it lay with Tristan to tell her the
truth. Moreover, she had lived amid dreams since
she had been brought from the Mad Mere into
Agravale. For her life’s woes were at an end; she
had forgotten that death still walked the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came to Tristan that morning in the
garden, and found him pacing under the trees,
fully harnessed, his sword at his side. There was
that same grim earnestness upon his face that she
had known of old when he had taken her to Holy
Guard through the woods. As she came with her
stately step over the grass betwixt the beds of
balsams and the thickets of fruit trees her eyes
grew dark under the sweep of her golden hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “you seem grim to-day.
Should we be sad at leaving the south?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced a little and looked into her eyes,
solemnly and sadly, like a man who suffered.
His earnest face awoke vague fears in her, sudden
dread of some fresh misfortune. She held out her
hands to him with a questioning smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “why are you silent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thinking,” he answered her, “of how our
lives change even in one setting of the sun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak,” she said, “for I am no child to be
kept carefully in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he answered, squaring his
shoulders and stiffening his great neck, “I thought
the sea had grown calm at last, and that no more
storms would come between us. Yet how frail are
the hopes of men. Once more the sword must
leave the sheath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reached out her arms to him with a sudden
cry and the mute look of a frightened child.
Tristan’s hands were upon her shoulders. There
was a divine tenderness upon his face as he looked
in her eyes and told her the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take courage,” he said to her, “for if ever a
man needed love, I, Tristan, am that man to-day.
Serjabil and his Saracens are marching for the
mountains, thinking to have an easy victory over
Christians weakened by their feuds. It is God’s
will that we should take the sword and save the
innocent from further shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hung in his arms, looking up like one
dazed into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan, what must follow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice shook a little as he answered her
words, holding her very close to him, like one who
knew not what the days might bring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said, “I go to hold the
mountain passes till Blanche and her men can
send me succour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have so few with you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are enough,” he said; “and if not enough,
where lies the shame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her head upon his shoulder with a
gesture of impatience, a pouting of the mouth that
did not escape him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you are mad,” she pleaded, “to risk
so much for those who have injured us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows, I fought not against the poor,”
he said, “but against the evil in high places.
Now comes the hour when I may save the
weak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde broke away from him suddenly and
stood apart, like one whose pride takes umbrage
at a threat. Her eyes grew bright with the impatience
of the moment, for, believing all storm
clouds to have passed from the sky, she had drifted
dreamily towards a haven of rest. The sudden
revulsion made her rebel against an enterprise that
to her seemed mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “you shall not go. Are
my wishes nothing in this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face appeared wreathed in shadows.
He looked at her sadly out of his dark eyes, as
though baffled by a mood that he had not foreseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you love a man,” he answered her,
“who played the coward and fled from fighting
for Christ and the Cross?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are no coward,” she retorted hotly. “I,
Rosamunde of Joyous Vale, can swear to that.
But as for this madness, I will not praise it; you
can play the hero without being a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not folly,” he said very patiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why tempt death,” she cried again,
“because your hot courage spurs you on? Wait
till the King and the Duchess come, till the
Southern Marches teem with steel and a thousand
banners blow to the wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By then,” he said, shaking his head, “Serjabil
and his men will have crossed the mountains and
given the countryside over to rapine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of the countryside?” she retorted,
growing less generous as her impatience increased.
“Who set the torch to the great forests,
and burnt homes and hamlets in the cause of
God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan started and caught his breath, as though
she had turned a sword against his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why taunt me,” he said, “because I fought
for you and Samson and the Seven Streams? It
was against the ruffians of the Church that I fired
the forest. God judge me if I did ill. The greater
be my duty now to guard the weak against the
strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so,” she said, with a flood of bitterness;
“the sword is more to you than a woman’s heart.
It is your glory that you love, your strength and
your great fame. I, a mere woman, must give
way to honour. For you are afraid, Tristan, lest
men should jeer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan clung by patience even though her
taunts were the more bitter by reason of their
ingratitude. Though he had imagined that Rosamunde
would have sped him with brave words,
even to death if God so willed it, he took her anger
more as the anger of a child than the strong purpose
of a grown woman. Therefore he stood out
before her, convinced of honour, and sure in his
own heart that she would turn to him when the
impetuous mood had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for glory,” he said, “shall I leave you
here. It is not easy to run from love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why go, then?” she cried, turning away her
head, her hands playing with the rich girdle about
her body. “Is duty the sorry nag that bears you
hence? Before Heaven, Tristan, if you refuse me
this, I will return to Holy Guard and live among
ruins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dark eyes followed her as she drifted to and
fro in her blue gown over the brilliant grass. She
was very lovely even in her anger, with her warm
cheeks and her eager eyes. Yet Tristan, having
a will more strong than her wrath, determined to
take her at her word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it,” he said, solemnly enough; “I will
send Telamon with you and twenty men. The
Gloire will bear you straight to the sea; Lilias’s
barge is moored in the shallows. Man can
promise no safer place than Holy Guard; if
the worst comes to the worst, you can sail for the
north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde looked at him, sudden wistfulness
shining through the mask of wrath, as though she
half doubted the truth of his words. There was
no wavering of Tristan’s eyes, no loosening of the
determined mouth. Her pride waxed in her as she
gazed on his face, perhaps because she felt that
she had earned his pity, in that she had failed him
when he needed her love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it, then,” she said, turning away under
the trees. “I shall be ready for Telamon before
the sun is at noon.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Like a proud star, Rosamunde of Joyous Vale had
set in the far west, over the wilds and the deep
woods that stretched towards the sea. Lilias’s forsaken
barge had borne her away down the silver
curves of the mighty Gloire, with Telamon at the
helm and ten men toiling at the oars. From a
tower on the walls of Agravale Tristan had watched
the gilded poop disappear into the gloom of the
woods. In anger Rosamunde had parted from him,
because he had set his duty before her love and had
dared to deny her the tyranny of tears. Tristan
wondered, as he watched from the tower, whether
he would behold her face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To horse, to horse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the trumpet’s cry that noon. Tristan
and his men tightened up the girths, rode out from
Agravale under the sun at its zenith, wound down
the steep road towards the river, crossed the stone
bridge, and held for the south. Their horses’
hoofs rang on the old Roman road that stretched
over the meadows like a great beam. They had
taken certain of the peasant folk with them as
guides, men who knew all the mountain passes
and the narrow defiles of St. Isidore’s Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the sun climbed, descended, and set in the
west, beating on the distant peaks with vapours of
crimson and gold. Knight Tristan rode at the
head of his men, his eyes fixed on the far mountains,
the purple slopes that rose from the plain,
the icy glimmer of the snow-white heights. He
rode as a man who considered death, to whom the
unknown stretched out like an unsailed sea. There
was great loneliness upon Tristan’s soul that evening,
for all the love seemed to have left his life,
and all his battlings to have ended in bitterness.
In the hour of trial Rosamunde had failed him,
had hid her face from him behind the mask of
pride. Nor cared he greatly what might befall
from that hour, since death would honour him
when hope stood apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night came with a round moon swimming in a
sky of dusky azure studded with the faces of many
stars. Tristan halted his men to rest them and
their horses on the march, for though the hours
were precious, he would not deny them the sleep
that they needed. They off-saddled at a little shrine
by the roadside, a shrine dedicated to St. Geneviève
by some good matron dead and gone. Roses
clambered about the walls and slim cypresses
streaked the misty grass where a little pool caught
the light of the moon. A grove of poplars stood
near in a broad meadow, the night breeze playing
in their mighty tops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Tristan, he had no hope of sleep, for
there were thoughts moving in his brain, tramping
like restless sentinels to and fro. The night seemed
full of ghostly voices, crying to him out of the
dark. He heard his mother’s voice, even as he
had heard it as a little child when his hands clung
to the folds of her gown. Also he listened to
Columbe weeping, as she had wept once in Purple
Isle long ago. Yet Rosamunde’s clear tones topped
them all. He remembered the songs he had heard
her sing in distant Joyous Vale to the women and
children of Ronan’s town. For him, perhaps, she
would sing no more. Tristan found himself wondering
in his heart whether she would weep if he
died in the mountains. Perhaps her anger would
melt away when she learnt that she had lost his
love for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan passed the night alone under the stars,
pacing to and fro on the white road, with the wind
playing in the poplar tops. Often he stood leaning
upon his spear, gazing towards the mountains
whose snowy peaks gleamed like white marble in
the distant south. Yonder in the yawning passes
and under the huge and savage crags he would
meet Serjabil and his men, rear up his shield
against their lances. There was much of the
soldier’s joy in the thought that his sword would
be measured against the scimitar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the dawn came, a golden haze rising in
the east. The poplars caught the streaming light;
in the meadows silvery mists smoked up; the far
woods glistened, seemed to tongue forth flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the gloom of the north a faint sound
shivered on the wind. Tristan heard it and stood
erect, peering along the empty road that ran so
straight under the tall trees. The sound seemed
to grow with the rising dawn, to swell into the
thunder of many hoofs, the clash and clangour of
hurrying steel. Vague lightnings came flashing
from the gloom, shield and helmet mimicking the
east. Huge mist-wrapped figures loomed out of
the north, mailed phantoms pressing through the
vapoury dawn along the white road betwixt the
trees. A trumpet sounded beside the shrine.
Tristan’s men came crowding up through the long
grass amid the burning cypresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A trumpet’s scream answered Tristan’s challenge.
Along the road rolled a hundred spears
behind Blanche the Duchess on her great white
horse, the Banner of the Bleeding Heart blowing
above. They came to a halt before the shrine amid
an eddying cloud of dust. Tristan and his men
ran to meet the Duchess, cheering her mightily
with great good will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche, big-hearted woman that she was, had
straightway turned when Percival had ridden in
with Tristan’s message concerning the Saracens.
She had sent a rider to overtake Lothaire, bidding
him march south again with all his men. Not
waiting for him to join her, she had used whip and
spur in her gallant haste to bring Tristan succour.
Only her bodyguard, some hundred spears, had
followed her past Agravale towards the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche climbed down from her jaded horse and
met Tristan face to face on the dusty road. The
soldiers on either side stood back out of rough
respect to these two great ones whose hands were
clasped in the cause of the Cross. Though Blanche
was weary with hard riding, her splendid spirit
seemed unquenched, her courage fresh as the
broadening dawn. Her eyes were very bright as
they gazed on Tristan’s: she smiled at him dearly,
held out her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old friend,” she said, “we meet again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan went down on one knee in the road and
kissed the hands that were stretched towards him.
Was she not a woman to serve and honour, a
woman who could strengthen a soldier’s heart and
give him help in the hour of need? She had seen
no madness in this ride of his, but rather the
desire of an heroic heart to bear the brunt against
heavy odds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said to her, still kneeling in the
dust, “Heaven wills it, it seems, that Tristan le
Sauvage should be your debtor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew her hands away from his, as though
half unwilling to see him kneel to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise up, Tristan,” she said; “it is my good
fortune that gives me the privilege. Where is
Rosamunde? Will you not lead me to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Tristan, when he heard her speak Rosamunde’s
name he went both red and white under
his tanned skin. He was jealous for Rosamunde,
yet half ashamed at having to justify her before
the Duchess. He would not have confessed, even
under torture, that Rosamunde had failed him in
her love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, rising up from his knees
and squaring his great shoulders against the truth,
“Rosamunde have I sent to Holy Guard, that she
might be safe there against all mischance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche had been watching Tristan’s face, the
shifting thought clouds that played over his eyes,
nor had his answer wholly deceived her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” she said. “Rosamunde at Holy
Guard? Was it her will that you should go alone
to this great venture, whence none may return?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was silent for one brief moment. Yet
Blanche had discovered much of the truth in that
short silence that held him mute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I planned for the best,” he made haste to
answer her. “Who knows what may happen to
us in the mountains? Should I drag love into the
van of battle, and cast such a pearl into Serjabil’s
treasury? Nay, Madame Blanche, give me but
fifty of your men, and I will hold the passes till
Lothaire comes south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Blanche’s face there was a mysterious light,
as though she rejoiced over some heaven-sent boon.
Her dark eyes shone under her silvery hair; her
voice rang deep as she gave Tristan her answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not fifty, but a hundred shall you have,” she
said, “and I, Blanche, will stand at your side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s eyes met hers in one long look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” he said, “you are too noble a soul to be
risked against Serjabil’s sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a woman,” she answered him very
simply, “a woman who loves to stand by those
who do not flinch when the wind blows keen. Am
I better than my men, who give their blood for
Christ and the Cross? No, I trow not. Who
fears death when those most dear are on the brink
of the grave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan answered her not a word, for he was
glad at heart of her great courage. He could have
blessed God for such a woman. Did not a deep
voice cry within him, “If only Rosamunde had
spoken thus!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>All that day and the next Tristan and the Duchess
rode south from St. Geneviève’s shrine, through
the woods and meadows, rich with the magic of
many flowers. The tall grass seemed as a rare
robe shot through with threads of diverse colours.
In the woods the ilex and the beech lifted their
broad domes towards the blue, and in the pastures
a myriad aspens shivered in the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the noon of the second day the lowlands
stretched back towards the north. Tristan
and his men came to a wilder region, where the
woods grew dark beneath the shadows of the
mountains. Through a multitude of poplars
whistling in the wind, amid fields spread with
poppies, yellow and red, the road curled through
dense thickets of chestnut and of beech. Higher
still, under the deepening darkness of the trees,
the road dwindled to a grass-grown track, so that
the armed men rode in single file, a silvery snake
that wavered through the green. Higher still, the
spruce and larch fretted the blue dome of the sky,
and heavenwards towered the silver firs and great
pines, sombre and huge of girth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the shade of a thicket of pines Tristan
halted at noon to rest his men. A spring played
by the roadside, where the thirsty riders drank
from their palms, and led their horses to drink at
the pool. Meanwhile, Tristan and the Duchess
went forward with the guide to a great rock that
was perched upon the hillside, and whence the
man promised them full view of St. Isidore’s Pass.
Above the trees the mountains towered, crag on
crag and cliff on cliff, till the mighty tops, aureoled
with golden vapour, clove the canopy of the sky.
Here and there a snow-capped peak gleamed and
flashed against the cloudless blue. Black gulfs
yawned everywhere, edged with a thousand glittering
crags, hoarse with the thunder of a thousand
streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before them lay St. Isidore’s Gate, a colossal
rent betwixt two mountains, full of gloom even
under the noon sun. Tristan and the Duchess
scanned the pass, while the peasant told them how
the road ran. At one point it dwindled to a narrow
track, on the one hand a precipice plunging
down, on the other the bluff shoulder of the mountain
rising straight towards the sky. A great rock
half closed the narrow track, and the gap was
known as St. Isidore’s Gate. It was a point that
could be held, the peasant said, by twenty men
against a thousand. Nor could they be outflanked
save by one wild track that led over the mountains
towards the east.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche laid a hand on Tristan’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us give to Bertrand, my best knight, some
eight score men to keep this path over the mountains.
You and I, Tristan, can hold the pass
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked into her fearless eyes, at the
face so strong and yet so tender. Once more he
besought her to consider her safety, and to remain
with Bertrand on the slopes above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are of greater worth,” he argued, “than
we rough men, whose business it is to make play
with the sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in Blanche’s soul deeper thoughts were
moving towards the coming crisis. She loved
Tristan, and in that hour when death was spreading
forth his wings she took less pains to dissemble
the truth. In the half-wistful sacrifice of
herself she lost none of the dignity of her heart.
Her rare womanliness seemed to stand the higher,
even because her love was a noble thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said to him, “am I better than
my men? Think you they will be the worse for
having a woman in their ranks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows,” he answered her, looking in her
eyes, “we shall fight the better if you are with
us in the pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore,” she said, smiling a little, “you
argue against your own plea. Is it not a woman’s
joy to stand fast by those whom she has loved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he answered her, colouring to the
lips, “would we were worthy of so great love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when the round moon stood full
upon the mountains, a line of spears glittered on
the road that threaded the pass. On high the
great peaks shone amid the stars, splashed with
the moonlight, ribbed with deep shadows. A
hundred torrents foamed in the ravines, their
massed thunder rising like the hoarse cries of a
multitude. Above, the peaks seemed monuments
of silence, sublime and tranquil as they communed
with the stars. Far below on the northern slopes
the moonlit forests beat like a sea upon the bases
of the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan and Blanche rode side by side, the
peasant trudging before their horses, an oaken staff
over his shoulder. There were deep lines of
thought on the woman’s face; it seemed wreathed
in shadows, though the moonlight played upon
her eyes and on the silver stephanos in her hair.
The sublimity of the scene had constrained them
to silence. Man and his machinations seemed
infinitely small under the grand calm of the towering
peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan’s thoughts had flown to Rosamunde
and all the turbulence of those short months since
he had sailed from Purple Isle to seek his sister
over the sea. Glimmerings of death seemed to
steal on him that night; vague voices called from
the bleak cliffs above; mystery encompassed him
and the strange twilight of the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady,” he said suddenly, turning towards her
in the moonlight, “how these torrents thunder.
Methinks I hear the voices of the dead crying
among the mountains. ‘Brother,’ they call me.
Never have I known this mood before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche’s eyes were fixed upon his face. She
saw no fear there, only some sadness round the
dogged mouth, a vague melancholy in the deep-set
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would not remember the dead,” she
answered him, “amid these great mountains under
the moon? Yonder white peak I would name the
Christ. Does he not shine on us out of the
night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even strong men die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so,” she said; “the great ones never die.
There is life in death for such as live like men.
Can knightliness and honour end in dust? Nay,
for they stand like these great mountains, rare
spirits fronting the evil of the world, standing for
God until the judgment come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true,” he answered her; “and should a
man grudge his poor dust to the All-Father who
has made us men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never would I mourn for one,” she cried,
“who died in some fair battle for the truth. They
are not dead these great ones who have stood like
mighty sentinels upon the towers of heaven. Joy
is the incense we should give to such, not empty
weeping and rebellious grief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left their horses on the lower slopes,
and by midnight had reached the summit of the
pass, where the road narrowed rapidly under the
shadow of the cliff. A great rock hung like a
bartizan over the precipice, narrowing the track
still further so that a natural gate gave passage
betwixt two walls of stone. A storm-twisted pine,
clinging to the cliff, cast a broad shadow over the
path, while over the thin grass the blue gentians
grew even to the edge of the great ravine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden cry topped the far thunder of the
torrents. Tristan’s guide stood beyond the rock,
his tall figure outlined by the moon. He was
pointing with his staff towards the south, beckoning
them on with eager gestures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Saracens, the Saracens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan sprang up beside him, his melancholy
gone in the flash of an eye. To the south a broad
valley stretched up betwixt the spurs of the mountains,
flooded by the tranquil light of the moon.
Crag upon crag fell away to the distant scene
where torrents ran like strands of flax into forests
that stood like early bracken. From the dim
depths where the pass began amid rolling woods
there came a sense of movement under the moon.
Columns of steel like shining beetles crawled up
the rugged slopes from the edge of the forest.
Nearer still under the bluff shoulder of a cliff the
mountain road lay clear before their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan whistled and laid his hand on his sword,
for there to the south in the pale moonlight came
long lines of armed men toiling up the pass towards
the Saint’s Gate. Buckler and lance caught the
moonbeams from afar; white tunics splashed the
sable rocks; glittering corselets were merged together
till the long columns of moving men seemed
like dragons of steel climbing the mountains.
Above stood the calm and silent peaks steeped in
the stillness of the heavens. Below, the many
torrents muttered, as though they cheered on the
advancing host.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>To the north of St. Isidore’s Gate the road
expanded into a broad platform, capable of holding
some hundred men. Many boulders were
strewn around, with squared stones fallen from
the ruined parapet that had once edged the sharp
precipice. Tristan and his men were quickly at
work, carrying stones towards the Gate, and piling
a rampart from the rock to the cliff. The peasant
who had served them as guide had swarmed up the
stem of the great fir and was perched amid the
branches, watching the Saracens as they climbed
the pass. Meanwhile, Tristan had sent a messenger
to warn Sir Bertrand on the heights above that
Serjabil was upon them with his host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon a broad bulwark, a Cyclopean wall, closed
the mouth of St. Isidore’s Gate. Tristan stood
under the shadow of the tree with Blanche the
Bold at his side. The melancholy that had possessed
the man but an hour before had passed
with the stir of the coming battle. He was once
more that Tristan of dogged will who had slain
Ogier the giant in fair fight and trodden down
Jocelyn into the dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spread his shoulders and smiled at the moon
as he stood with Blanche upon the rough stone
wall. His nostrils dilated with his deep breathing
as he watched the columns climb the pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a day and a night,” he said, “and Lothaire
should come. We could hold this wall for a week,
I trow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” she answered him; “yet before the
moon climbs up again all my rough children from
the north should tumble up to save their lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only Bertrand holds the mountain path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertrand will stand to the last sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, by Heaven, we shall not fail him. God
willing, I would hold the pass alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon had passed behind one of the western
peaks when Serjabil’s men came climbing up to
where the fir tree grew by the Gate. A broad
shadow was thrown athwart the pass, so that the
road was plunged in gloom. Tristan had ordered
his force into five companies, each numbering
some fifty men. They were to reinforce each other
from hour to hour, so that all could rest in turn.
They lay quiet behind the wall, waiting calmly for
Tristan’s orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan crouched behind a boulder, his shield
on his arm, his sword in his hand. Around him
were stretched the motionless figures of his men,
like leopards crouching for the spring. The stars
were very bright in the sky, since the moon had
sunk behind the peak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then above the distant roar of the streams came
the sound of voices, the jingling of steel, the dull
padding of a thousand feet. Tristan, peering
round a rock, saw a man on a white mule turn an
angle of the cliff with a long line of lances at his
back. White robes showed in shadows as the men
marched up, recking nothing of what would follow.
When they were within twenty yards of the Gate,
the emir on the white mule drew rein in the road,
and looked ahead into the darkness. Tristan could
see a broad turban wreathing a dusky oval face. It
was plain that the man had marked the barrier
before him, and was debating its nature and what
lay behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke some words to his men, and pointed
them towards the tree and the rock overhanging
the precipice. Then figures sprang forward, came
running up the road towards the wall across the
Gate. Tristan heard them muttering one to
another as they clambered up the rough pile of
stones; a turbaned head showed above the summit;
another followed it, and yet another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan sprang up with a great shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God and the Cross!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty shields heaved up around him. There
was the shrill whistle of whirling blades, the sound
of strokes that went heavily home. Several white-robed
bodies rolled back from the rampart, and the
first blood had been shed for the Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the pass under the moonlight the long
columns could be seen to waver and halt as the
trumpets screamed amid the mountains, the echoes
tonguing from crag to crag. The emir on the
white mule rode back among his men, pointing
them towards the Gate with his naked scimitar.
The advance guard raised a great shout, and came
pouring up with bucklers forward, calling on Allah
and Mohammed the Prophet. Lithe, dusky warriors
in quilted tunics and shirts of mail came
clambering up the rude stone rampart, to take the
spear-thrusts in their faces and meet the swing of
the pitiless swords. Not a single man of them
could top the parapet. Soon white-clad figures lay
piled against the wall, like snow driven there by
the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These light-armed folk gave back by their
emir’s orders to make way for Serjabil’s guard, the
choice troops of the Caliph’s provinces, harnessed
in chain mail and finely armed. They came up the
road in a long column, their bucklers blinking at
the moon, to be eclipsed in the shadows athwart
the Gate. Like foam they dashed against the wall,
with its ranks of shields and spears above. Vain
was their fatalistic valour, the courage that claimed
an eastern paradise. Time after time they clambered
up to melt away before the wall. The dead
were piled in the narrow road with cloven bucklers
and broken spears. Many a man grudged not his
blood that night for the languorous glances of the
black-eyed girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When dawn came they rolled back baffled from
St. Isidore’s Gate. Serjabil himself rode forward
on a mule; his keen black eyes took in the truth,
the rugged hazards of that narrow way. It seemed
to him that he had spent the night in throwing
snow against a rock. With the dawn he embraced
a subtler means, ordered his men to bend their
bows and shoot their arrows high in the air. Moreover,
he sent a thousand men to climb the path
that wound over the mountain where Sir Bertrand
lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the fight went on that day, with the whistling
of arrows over the wall, where Tristan and
his men lay low. From the heavens the shafts
came rattling down, dancing upon the upreared
shields, taking a life from time to time. There
were many skirmishes upon the wall, and single
combats, wherein Tristan slew seven tall Saracens
born of one mother. It was Serjabil’s plan to
wear the Christians out, to hold them in play while
his thousand men forced the path that crossed the
mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards sunset Tristan stood under the shelter
of the great rock, leaning upon his sword. He
had come down from the wall to rest after the
long day’s fighting in the sun. The shield that
hung about his neck had been battered deviceless
by the Saracen spears. A scarf was knotted round
his right thigh, where an arrow had gored him,
but had not sped deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche the Bold stood at Tristan’s side. She
had tended the wounded, and they had been many,
under the shadow of the rock that day. Now her
eyes searched Tristan’s face for foreshadowings of
defeat, or wounds within. She saw no weakening
of the dogged mouth, no bowing down of the
massive head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I judge,” he said to her, leaning on his
sword, “that we have lost this day some hundred
men. These cursed archers have smitten us
often.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche stood silent, as though her thoughts
sped to the hamlets of the north, where women and
children would grieve for the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether we live or die,” she said, “we stand
here for a noble cause. Nor shall we flinch from
the last blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen,” quoth Tristan, a smile on his mouth.
“We can fight for another night and a day, if
Bertrand can keep the path above.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By then Lothaire and the host will be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Bertrand holds the path above.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a prophetic spirit in these words, for
hardly had they passed from Tristan’s lips than
there came sound as of thunder from the cliffs
above. Tristan looked up, rapped out an oath,
pressed Blanche back against the wall. A great
rock came hurtling down, scattering stones from
the rugged slope. It leapt out from the last ledge,
flew spinning over the narrow road, to disappear
into the depths beneath. Tristan’s hand was on
Blanche’s wrist. Above the mutterings of the
streams they heard the great rock crash below into
the branches of the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God,” said Tristan, “they have forced the
path!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the mountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bertrand has been beaten back. They are
rolling the rocks on us, curse their souls!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set his arm about Blanche’s body and almost
bore her to the foot of the cliff, where there was
a shallow hollowing of the stone. They could hear
the shouts of Serjabil’s men, who cheered when
they saw that the heights were won. Tristan’s
men were huddling up under the shelter of the
cliff; they could face these Saracens on the
wall, but not the rocks that smoked from the
mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche lay back against the cliff and looked
long into Tristan’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is yet time,” she said to him suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To fly down the pass into the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He darted a look at her and threw back his
head, his mouth firm, his eyes fearless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for me,” he said, “I stay at the Gate.
Take the rest with you and meet Lothaire on the
road. Tell him and Didcart how I died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spread out her arms against the cliffs, as
though crucified by her own courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so,” she said; “I will not go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make no pleading with me, Tristan,” she said,
“for my heart is fixed concerning this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid a hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my sake, go, madame,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your sake,” she answered, “I will not stir
hence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood looking for full half a minute into
each other’s eyes, as though Tristan sought to read
the truth that was shining on him out of her soul.
Unconscious of the gesture, he laid his right hand
over his forehead, for he understood of a sudden
in that hour that Blanche loved him, even to the
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he cried hoarsely, “what can I say
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, Tristan,” she said, with a strange
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan was almost fearful of looking in her
face. What were mere words to her but mocking
symbols? Did she not know of his full love for
Rosamunde? It was only at death’s gate that she
had betrayed the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shower of stones came rattling down the
cliff, dancing like huge hailstones on the rugged
road. A great rock crashed down upon the wall,
slew five men there among those who held the Gate.
The rest cowered back under the cliff, while the
Saracen arrows sped from the pass, dealing out
death in the crowded space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan saw that it would be but slow slaughter,
and that twenty men were as good as a hundred,
now that the platform was swept by the stones.
He stood forward and shouted to the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers,” he said, “I crave but a score of
you to stand beside me, to hold the Gate to the
bitter end. Let the rest make for the road to
Agravale and tell Lothaire of how we stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men crowding under the cliff heard him in
silence, half ashamed of their own fears. First one
stood out and then another, till twenty were mustered
at Tristan’s side. He bade the rest make
haste to depart lest they should be caught in the
pass and cut off from Agravale. Thus he was left
with but twenty swords to hold the Saint’s Gate
against the Saracens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the moon rose on the snowy peaks and
on the solemn foreheads of the mountains. Clouds
passed slowly over its surface, building caverns and
deep forests of silver in the magic silence of the
sky. Ever and anon the Saracen trumpets
screamed exultantly on the heights above. The
mountains awoke to the roar of the rocks forced
from their sleep on the wind-swept slope to
thunder down into the depths beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan kept his twenty men under the cliff,
that they might escape these grinding, hurtling
bolts that leapt out of the calm sky into the pass.
He had climbed the wall, and lay prone in the
angle under the trunk of the great tree. Thence
he could watch the stormers on the road beneath
and warn his men when the tide rolled up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was he left long in such a posture, with the
flat of his sword under his chin. A clarion wailed
in the darkness of the pass, warning those on the
heights above to cease from hurling down the
rocks. Spear and buckler flashed up once more
as the moon’s eye was uncovered by a cloud. With
a great shout Tristan sprang up with sword aloft,
his men thronging round him on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the moon sank into the west and huge
shadows covered the cliffs. About St. Isidore’s
Gate the dead lay thick, where Serjabil’s Saracens
had recoiled once more. Yet empty of triumph
was that desperate rally for those score heroes who
held the wall. Tristan stood alone there on the
bloody rampart, bleeding from a spear-thrust in
his throat as he leant heavily upon his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice called to him out of the gloom, and
Blanche’s hand was on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help you, Tristan,” she said in his ear.
“Is it death with you, soul of my soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He staggered back against the cliff, while she
held a wine-flask to his lips, then tore the scarf
from off her bosom, and strove to staunch the blood
from his throat. He leant heavily against the cliff,
fighting for his breath, half dead with travail.
Blanche’s arms went about his body, and she half
bore his weight as she watched him suffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “Tristan, Tristan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his head wearily, so that it half rested
upon her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am athirst,” he said, “give me more wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reached down and held the flask again to
his lips, drawing his right arm over her shoulder
so that he leant his weight upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, look up,” she said at length. “Is it
death with you? Great heart, take courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very weary,” he said, closing his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest here, then,” she answered; “I can bear
your weight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly the dawn was streaming up, calm and
clear after that night of travail. The peaks were
glistening in the sky, the heavens mellowing from
grey to blue. Under the white brows of the mountains,
Tristan and Blanche were alone together,
among the stricken and the dead. In death it
seemed they would not be parted, though love and
life had denied the dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the woman’s arm tightened about
Tristan’s body. The colour returned to her weary
face; her eyes grew bright like the eyes of one who
hears deliverance in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” she said, “listen, listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From afar came the stirring cry of a horn, a
wild blast echoing among the mountains. From
afar seemed to rise the shouts of men, strong and
vigorous, hurrying to battle. A faint clamour
came from the heights whence Bertrand had been
driven by Serjabil’s Saracens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Lothaire,” Blanche said; “they are climbing
the pass. Hear how the heathen give tongue
above us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan struggled up and gripped his sword.
A second life seemed to breathe in his body; a
second courage filled his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, they come at last!” he cried, with
his eyes taking fire. “Give me a shield and I will
hold the Gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated a moment, then did his bidding,
groping among the dead men by the wall. She
thrust a shield on Tristan’s arm, her hands
trembling, her eyes dim with tears. For the sake
of his glory she was sending him forth to die in
the pass for Christ and the Cross. Even as she
armed him; she heard the sound of men storming
towards the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan turned to her with the smile of a hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One more fight,” he said, “and I shall have
fought my fill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears were shining on Blanche’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, Tristan,” she said, “and I will follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent towards her and kissed her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therewith, he sprang up towards the parapet,
and set his shield before his face. A hundred
bucklers were surging up, with corselet and tunic
playing beneath. Over the death wrack of the
place the sons of the Crescent came streaming up.
A single warrior held the wall as the dawn deepened
and the night elapsed. Thus did Tristan take his
stand with Blanche the Bold at St. Isidore’s Gate.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Cross, Holy Cross!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the shouts that set the wild cliffs
echoing as hundreds of painted shields came up
the pass to meet the dawn. Above, Sir Didcart
with three thousand men had fallen upon those
Saracens who had put Bertrand and his band to
rout and had rolled down the rocks on Tristan at
the Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up the road came Lothaire of the north, his
men racing shoulder to shoulder behind him, panting
open-mouthed towards St. Isidore’s Gate. The
great rock with its black pinnacles flashed into
view, the platform strewn with the Christian dead,
the narrow rampart piled with the slain. For one
moment Lothaire stood still in the road. Then
with a shout he broke away, waving his men on
with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the rampart, outlined against the sky, stood
a single warrior with his shield reared up, while
his sword flashed and swept from side to side. A
mob of white-robed infidels topped the wall, thrusting
at him with their lances, fearing to close. Near
by stood a woman wielding a spear, with which
she strove to beat down the lance points that were
levelled at the man’s body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Cross, Holy Cross, God and the
Duchess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as Lothaire’s men charged up, Tristan
gave ground, for an arrow had smitten through
the rings of his hauberk, and wounded him sorely
in the breast. A tall Saracen, seeing him stagger,
sprang forward and smote at him with an axe, but
fell in turn beneath Tristan’s sword. Yet this was
the last blow Tristan gave on the bloody rampart
of St. Isidore’s Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche’s arms caught him as he fell; her body
shielded him from the spears. Lothaire’s men saw
their Duchess stand like a noble mother guarding
a son. One outstretched arm pressed the infidels
back; the other was round the stricken man’s
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the roar of the rising tide as Lothaire
and his avengers reached the Gate and poured up
to save the Duchess there. The stalwart West
rolled the Orient back, over the wall and down the
road, with bustling shields and screaming steel.
Buckler and lance went down in the dust, while
the dragon of the North heaved on down the pass,
its iron flanks hurling Serjabil’s men over the precipice
into the depths beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan lay under the shadow of the cliff with
the Saracen’s arrow betwixt his ribs. Beside him
knelt Blanche, her noble hands dyed with the blood
of the man she loved. Many a rough soldier stood
mutely by, gazing on their lady and the man at
her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wine,” she called to them almost fiercely,
“wine, ye fools, and linen, bring them. Ha,
Walter, come hither, man, unfasten this hauberk.
Thus—thus. Tristan, look up; is it death with
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan stared in her face and smiled. They
stripped off his hauberk, rent the clothes beneath
till the flesh was bare about the barb. Blanche,
with her teeth set, snapped off the shaft, but dared
not do more, for the blood flowed fast. Her men
brought her linen, strips that they had torn from
the robes of the dead Saracens who lay around.
Two soldiers supported Tristan’s shoulders, while
Blanche wound the bands about his body, padding
the place where the barb remained, knotting the
linen tight to staunch the flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her men made a litter out of a dozen spears
with shields and clothing laid thereon. Very tenderly
they lifted Tristan up, and bore him slowly
down the road from the Saint’s Gate he had held
so well. The great peaks glistened in the sun; the
streams sang in the ravines beneath. Thus they
bore Tristan from the mountains towards the woods
that clothed the lower slopes, where they had left
a horse litter that they had brought from Agravale
for their lady’s use on the homeward road. Reaching
the shadows of the trees, they laid Tristan
within the litter and took the road towards the
north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many hours had passed, and the gates of the
shrine of St. Geneviève were opened full towards
the west. The evening sunlight streamed within,
warming the white stones in the floor, gilding the
carved panels of the tomb. The wooden roof
received the glow reflected from the stones beneath,
so that its colours seemed to breathe with deepening
dyes over the dead saint’s grave. Through the
latticed windows roses climbed, dowering the air
with a passionate incense that even in life suggested
death. In the garden the cypresses, like
black-robed Fates, spun the golden threads from
the distaff of the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan lay before the tomb with his great hands
folded upon his breast. His eyes were turned
towards the painted roof, where golden dragons
seemed to move amid stars and moons, and meteor
flame. Slowly his breath flowed in and ebbed
under the crossed hands on his breast. Very silent
was the shrine; the light seemed the more reverent
for the saint’s tomb there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan turned his face towards the door with
the wistful look of a stricken child listening for
the sound of a mother’s voice. Little more than a
year had passed away since he had knelt in the
chapel of Purple Isle and watched his arms for
Columbe’s sake. Then his heart had echoed back
the sounding surges of the sea. Then in the high
tide of youth he had heard no requiems and no
ghastly cries stirring the pulses of the world.
’Twas different now; all changed the tones, the
lights and shadows, the colours’ scheme. While
the sunbeams slept upon the floor death seemed
nearer than life itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A figure darkened the gate of the shrine, the
figure of a woman who stood looking towards the
tomb. She drew near to the place where Tristan
lay on the warm stones under the painted roof.
Blanche’s eyes were full of pity as she gazed on
the strong man lying there, so weak and still was
he, so changed in three days. Was this Tristan
who had held the mountains, whose arm had been
mighty in the van of battle? How white he was
since the precious blood had ebbed hour by hour
from the barb in his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat herself down on the tomb’s steps beside
him and felt that his eyes were fixed on hers.
There was an unuttered prayer upon his lips. He
looked like a man who thirsted for water, but could
not crave the cup from her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, what would you?” she asked, reading
in his eyes that dim desire that appealed to the
woman in her like the look of a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved restlessly upon the bed, his fingers
plucking at the hem of the coverlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no heart in me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No heart, Tristan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To ask a boon of you at this last hour. For
you have blessed me many times, nor have I
aught but gratitude to give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out a hand and touched his forehead,
knelt close to him, looking sadly in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you have given me, Tristan,”
she asked, “other than the gratitude of a good
heart? Am I one to crave weight for weight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she knelt on the stones the sunlight gathered
about Tristan’s face, so that it seemed haloed round
with gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My soul wings towards Holy Guard,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would that I might look on Rosamunde
again and hear her speak to me before I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche leant back against the tomb and stared
out straight through the open door. For the
moment she saw nothing but the arch of gold, and
set therein a woman’s face, fair with all fairness,
rich with youth. In Blanche’s heart there was
sudden bitterness, since she knew that she was
growing old, and that love flew forth to the face
of youth. In life this Rosamunde had stood
between, and even in death the man’s last thoughts
flew past her to Holy Guard by the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she looked at Tristan’s face, with its
wistful eyes and haggard mouth. How weak he
was, how like a child’s this his last desire.
Should she balk him when death stood by? No,
by God, she was nobler than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, “I will send to Holy
Guard and fetch Rosamunde hither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face brightened strangely at her words, but
there was still a cloud before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, send not to Holy Guard,” he said, “for
days will elapse in the coming and going. And
the lamp may be quenched before they return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you, then?” she asked him
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lo,” he said, “does not the great Gloire run
from Agravale towards the sea? Set me, I pray
thee, in a boat, and let them row me down to the
sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of your wound?” she asked once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blood,” he said, “flows from me still,
though I lie here on the chapel floor. Therefore,
I pray thee, bear me hence, that I may come to
Holy Guard before I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it,” she said. “God grant thee life to
behold thy love’s face.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>They bore Tristan from the shrine of St. Geneviève
northwards towards Agravale and the waters of
the Gloire. All one day and a night they were
on the road, riding slowly, since Tristan’s wound
would stand but little jolting of the litter. Ever
beside him rode Blanche the Bold, sorrowful at
heart for Tristan’s sake, and for the last hours that
she grudged to another. Had she not played the
nobler part and contrasted her pity with Rosamunde’s
pride? Yet to Tristan the end would be
bitter if he looked not again on Rosamunde’s face,
for the red stream never ceased to flow from where
the barb was buried deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dawn when they came to the great Gloire
and saw Agravale tower on the heights above,
smitten with the sunlight from the east. Very
peaceful seemed the green meadows where the tall
poplars barred back the dawn. All the world
seemed bathed in dew; the odours of flowers
breathed in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the old stone bridge they found boats
moored to the grey quays above the river. Blanche
chose a black barge that lay in the shallows, and
by Tristan’s desire he was set in the prow with his
face turned towards the west. Twenty of Blanche’s
men manned the barge, stout fellows who had
held the thwarts in the north when the Duchess’s
galley put out to sea. She herself was in the
prow, where Tristan had been laid on the narrow
deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barge foamed away on the bosom of the
Gloire, gliding with the strong current as two men
toiled at each great oar. Agravale and its white
towers dwindled into the azure above the woods as
the sun stood full in the eastern sky. Far to the
south the white peaks gleamed, seeming to watch
the barge pass down the broad river towards the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very solemn were the wilds that summer day,
as the Gloire spread its curves under the towering
hills. Gnarled trees drank like hoar warriors at
the brink, and betwixt the sable deeps of the woods
the grassland was broidered with many flowers.
Sunlight and shadow were embattled there where
the hills bristled against the dawn, and the river
gleamed into rippling bays with a thousand
lightnings threading the green. Deep were the
mysteries of the woods and deep the chanting of
the river as the sedges sang of the distant sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan lay in the prow of the barge with his
face turned towards the west. Like one in a dream
he watched the woodland waving by, the great trees
splashed with gold by the sun, the meadows ablaze
with a myriad flowers. Sometimes he would gaze
into the blue above and watch the white clouds
sailing by, or a hawk like a black speck poised in
the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the hours sped as in a dream while the
barge swept on down the river, the oars swinging
with the steady rhythm of a song. Sometimes
Tristan counted the strokes till they seemed like
the breathing of a mighty beast. Often he would
fancy that Holy Guard towered up before him
against the blue, or starting, he would seem to
hear Rosamunde’s voice calling his name as the
water bubbled about the prow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche the Duchess watched beside him, wondering
whether his life would ebb before they
brought him to the sea. With her own hands she
gave him food and wine for the staying of his
strength. Her voice indeed was as the voice of a
mother as she tended him there, forgetting self in
the hope that his prayers should not prove in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, Tristan,” she would often say, with
her mouth close to the wounded man’s ear, “the
stream runs fast, and there is blood in you yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So night came, and with it a summer storm of
wind and rain sweeping up the valley from the sea.
The men covered Tristan with a canopy of rough
cloth, and propped their shields round him to
shelter his bed. Gloom wrapped the woods where
the tall trees battled with the wind. The Gloire’s
waves were capped with foam, yet the men at the
oars rowed on and on. No sounds were there save
the groaning of the looms, the heavy downrush of
the storm, the plashing of the water at the prow.
Truly did the Gloire seem a river of the dead as the
black barge forged on against the wind and rain,
with the hoarse moan of the forest filling the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet as the dawn came the clouds gave back and
a clear sky waited in the west. Soon the sun rent
the vapoury veil, flashing upon the distant mountains,
while the wind sank to utter rest. The woods
seemed wrapped in a shimmering mist and golden
smoke wreathed all the hills. The huge shadows
were startled from their sleep where every tree
top pearled by the rain glimmered and flashed
towards the dawn. The great Gloire laughed as
the light came up and the drenched meadows smiled
in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan had slept that night through the rain
and the wind, for sheer weariness had brought him
dreams. In his sleep he had beheld Rosamunde
walking the waters, treading the river to meet the
barge. Her face had lit the waters like the moon,
and crimson flames had wreathed her feet as they
touched the waves that flowed betwixt the woods.
Her gown was of a splendid green, so bright that
it was as some rare emerald shot through with the
sun. She had come to the barge and entered in,
knelt down by Tristan and kissed his lips. And
with that dream kiss Tristan awoke to find the dim
woods dripping dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was this dream, or the clear morning
air, or the long sleep that had held him through
the hours, Tristan felt stronger with the dawn.
Steadily the long oars still laboured on, for ten
men rested while ten men rowed. There was to
be no halting towards the sea, and with the swift
stream the barge moved fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche had been long awake at Tristan’s side,
watching the woods as they hurried by with the
flower-filled valleys lying between. She had set
her cloak to dry in the sun, and had spread her
drenched hair over her shoulders. At the first lifting
of Tristan’s lids she was quick to greet him
with a smile and a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dawn,” he said; “how long have I slept?
Are we nearer Holy Guard and the sea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men have rowed all night,” she answered
him. “You have slept, Tristan, while we have
watched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange smile played upon the man’s lips,
the smile of one who remembered a dream, some
shining forth of a mystic face from the shifting
vapours of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have dreamed a dream,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Tristan,” she echoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Methinks that I shall reach the sea and live
to be carried into Holy Guard. Hark, whose
voice is that? The steersman calls to us from the
poop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of Blanche’s men who steered the barge
was pointing to where the tall woods were broken
by a valley. Under a thick mist they could see the
shining through of a goodly river, streaked and
silvered by the sun. Its waters came fretting round
a rocky point to merge into the bosom of the
Gloire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Lorient,” quoth Blanche, standing
and looking under her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tristan half raised himself upon his elbow and
gazed over the low bulwarks towards the woods.
A tawny flood came flashing down to smite into
the Gloire’s more silver breadth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lorient,” he said; “then we are but ten
leagues from the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By nightfall we should come to Holy Guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sank back again upon the bed with a spasmodic
catching of the breath as the barb twinged
in his wounded side. Fresh blood stained the linen
bands. He coughed and winced as Blanche knelt
by him and gave him wine out of an earthen flask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, Tristan, courage,” she said; “for by
God’s grace we shall bring you to Holy Guard
before the night shall come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the day passed, and the great Gloire coursed
on with broadening grandeur towards the sea. The
silent thickets clambered down to where the glittering
inlets played on sandy banks and amid the
sedges. Ever the meadows lay between, streaked
with green rushes and with golden flags, while the
sky seemed full of thunder clouds, of light and
shadow, and of shimmering mists that wreathed
the hills with golden smoke. Ever the great trees
seemed to sing of death as the barge swept on
towards the sea.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was sunset at Holy Guard, and a strong wind
blew from over the sea, where the tide was low, and
the sands were purpled with the shadows of the
clouds. The breakers were white on the distant
rocks and about the black islands scattered there
upon the bosom of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruin possessed Holy Guard, for Jocelyn’s men
had laboured hard to fulfil the commands of the
mighty Pelinore. Thus in the old days the Church
knew well how to use the saints she herself had
created. She could conjure with many a magic
name and frighten the froward with the shades of
the dead. Such prelates as Jocelyn could cheat
their own creed with a cunning that claimed
Heaven, though born of the Devil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chapel roof of Holy Guard had fallen in on
the broken pillars and the grass-grown floor. The
frescoes rotted on the walls, and through the empty
casement frames shone vistas of sea and sky and
wood. The wild voice of the wind played through
the abbey, the red fires of the sunset glimmered in,
and moonlight pierced the broken roof. Bats and
sea-birds haunted the shadows ’mid the creaking
and clashing of the doors and the hoarse roar of
the waves beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a ruined window in the Abbess’s room stood
Rosamunde of Joyous Vale looking out towards
the night. Telamon and his men were quartered
below in the bare refectory and the empty cells.
On a rough stool in the midst of the room sat the
girl Miriam, whom Tristan had saved with Rosamunde
from the madhouse in the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady of Joyous Vale leant against the stone
sill with her face resting betwixt her hands. There
was but little light in her shadowy eyes, and her
shoulders drooped from the fair sweep of her neck,
as though she were weary, and had known no
sleep. She stood there motionless, like one whose
thoughts sped far away over the dim horizon into
the distant land of dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl Miriam watched her lady, crooning to
herself some ancient song with a faint smile on
her full red lips. She was not unhappy, this
Hebrew child, though she wondered, as she sat
there, what had passed betwixt the woman who
brooded by the window and Tristan who had gone
to the mountainous south. That Rosamunde was
sorrowful she knew full well, since her sorrow
spoke on her wistful face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From below came the sound of a man singing
the staunch lines of some old song forged in the
smithies of the north. The girl Miriam smiled,
and pressed one hand over the charm that hung
over her heart. Rosamunde seemed to droop the
more as she bowed down her head towards the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam rose from her stool, went to Rosamunde,
and touched her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ails you?” she said. “May I not
help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is nothing, child,” came the dull response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ill, lady, in body or in heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why question me, girl, when I have no
answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Miriam’s hands were on Rosamunde’s
arm, and her eyes were very gentle under her
dusky hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I but a child, then?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I not suffered, am I not wise in a
woman’s way? Ah, my lady, let me in. We have
shared much together; trust me further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly Rosamunde took her hands from
her face, and turned and looked into Miriam’s
eyes. No vulgar curiosity did she find therein,
no insolent challenging of the truth. The girl’s
face seemed softened by pity, yet not that pert
patronage that affronts the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” she said sadly, turning again towards
the east, “how easily are we women fooled by
pride, driven to cheat our nobler self by the mad
anguish of a passionate moment. Would to God
I had had less pride!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miriam drew to her with her lithe, warm body,
as though her very nearness should speak of
sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady,” she said, “we women err according
to the fierceness of our instincts. Love turns to
lightning in a moment; or, like the moon, we
frown at a cloud that dulls for an instant the
distant stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true,” said Rosamunde, gazing towards
the woods. “Words wound us too easily when
we dote on words and behold not the truth that
shines beneath. We cannot always bear the truth
when that same truth wounds our desire. So we
rebel, even as a good hound will turn when stung
by the lash in a master’s hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet it is not love that turns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but the quick instinct of a passionate
heart that snaps at destiny, to repent betimes. For
when the pain is quick and keen, the finer reason
slacks the lead, and the hot self leaps out on love,
only to slink when the wrath is past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant her chin once more upon her hands
and watched the azure deepen in the east, with
the vain anguish of her penitence. Was it but a
week since she had come from Agravale to the
sea, stirred by the unreasoning fever of her wrath?
Yet day by day her heart had cooled, till naught
seemed left in it but slow despair. “Tristan,
Tristan!” cried her soul. Often she would thrust
her arms out in the night, and pray that Tristan
might return once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as she stood there, gazing over the hills
and woods where the river wound down towards
the sea, she saw a black shape glide from the trees
over the broadening bosom of the Gloire. She
saw oars flash and glisten against the setting sun.
Right in the golden path came a barge, bearing
for Holy Guard across the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde stood back and watched the boat
with both hands folded over her heart. Then
without a word she sprang away, sped down the
galleries in the dusk, where many a shaft of gold
smote through the narrow windows in the walls.
Out through the ruined gate she sped, and down
the rough path towards the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was she so speedy that she reached the
river before the barge had foamed up to the strand,
where a narrow waterway wound to a wooden
quay. Rosamunde, halting under a wind-twisted
fir, saw four soldiers moving up the path, bearing
upon a bed the figure of a man. Before them,
some twenty paces, walked a woman whose face
was turned towards the walls of Holy Guard.
Rosamunde knew her as she climbed the path,
Blanche of the North, even the Duchess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women met on the narrow path that
climbed the wild hillside from the waters of the
Gloire. A great glory covered the sea, while the
dark woods seemed steeped in shadow, as though
the trees had drawn black cowls over their green
polls. From the west came the hoarse murmur
of the waves, as they foamed in over the yellow
sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche held out her hands to Rosamunde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister,” she said, “I bring you back Tristan
from the mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Rosamunde, she was white as death,
nor had she words wherewith to answer the
Duchess. Going to the litter, she saw Tristan
lying there with a grey face and great shadows
under his sunken eyes. So weak was he that he
could but stretch a hand to her as she drew near
and touched his forehead with her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said, with a great sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hot tears fell upon his face, as she wept
there, even before the men who bore him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, look not thus at me,” she said, “for
I have been shamed out of all my pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed on up the bare hillside with the
moss-grown rocks lit by the setting sun. The
perfume of the myrtle thickets scented the air,
tossed abroad by the wild west wind. Over the
sands rolled the rising tide, flowing fast under the
flaming sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus they brought Tristan towards Holy
Guard, its black walls haloed by the west. Rosamunde
walked beside the bed with Tristan’s hand
clasped fast in hers. The Duchess Blanche had
drawn apart, a deep calm on her stately face, an
unfathomable sadness filling her eyes. She had
surrendered love into Rosamunde’s hands, and
would fain be alone to hide the smart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They carried Tristan through the gate, up the
great stairway, and through the dim galleries into
the chamber of the Abbess. There they left Rosamunde
and the man alone, for Blanche would
suffer none to meddle in the sacred meeting of
the twain. She closed the door on them with
her own hands, and passed out to the battlements
to watch the sea drown the darkening sands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the twilight of the room Rosamunde knelt
by Tristan’s bed, and bowed down her face over
him as one who mourned. Through many a
window the west wind moaned, and death seemed
to move through the ruined house. In Rosamunde’s
eyes there was a strange despair, for she
had read the truth at the first glance, and her
heart cried out in her as the night came down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan,” she said, with her pride in the
dust, “I have sinned against you and your love.
Ah, God, must I lose all at this hour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grieve not,” he answered her, “for what is
past. Fate has ever bruised our hearts; and
though I die, I have love in death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a great light within his eyes, but
Rosamunde’s face was hid in shadow. Not for
her was the empty boast of love, the last triumph-cry
of a wounded soul. She broke out suddenly
into bitter weeping, and hung over Tristan as she
wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love,” she said, with her words half
smothered and her hair falling upon his face,
“how can I lose you out of my life? O God,
have pity! Is it for this that I have passed
through all? Tristan, Tristan, is it death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very tenderly he held her hands, and strove to
comfort her as the night increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is God’s will,” he said at last. “I have
fought my fight, and the end is near. And yet I
shall not win the spoil, for death steps in—thus
ends the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God is not merciful,” she cried, “to those who
grieve and sorrow here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew her down to him, so that his face was
wreathed in the glory of her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us not judge,” he said, “those things
which ever balk our ken. Are we not children?
Wife, take courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clung to him, and kissed his lips, as
though to shut the warm life in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Tristan, Tristan, that I also might die!”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A night and a day had passed, and Tristan lived
on, though the blood still flowed from his wounded
side. Blanche and Rosamunde had dressed the
wound with oil and wine and diverse herbs, but
the barb would suffer no healing there, and the red
stream still ebbed slowly forth. They saw that
Tristan weakened hour by hour, his great hands
growing white as a young girl’s, his eyes shining
like crystal in a mask of wax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde watched at his side, counting the
hours by the dial of her heart, neither sleeping
nor leaving him long alone. As she saw him
weakening with his wound, the fiercer mood returned
to her heart as though to defy the power
of death. It was not against Tristan that it arose,
this passionate anger that strove with Fate. To
the man she was mild and tender as moonlight,
gentle towards him as the hours sped by. Against
God it was that her heart cried out, against the
God who would not hear her prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the second evening came, with the
night’s fatalism deepening in the east, she passed
out from the room like one whose heart could bear
up no longer against despair. It was not to weep
that she sped away and climbed to the topmost
wall of Holy Guard. Nor was it for prayer in the
gentler sense, but rather to fling her burning
wrongs full in the countenance of the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was setting over the sea like some
great slave of the Creator, doomed to tread an
eternal track amid the planets of the sky. The
clouds, like demons, scourged him on, breathing
forth fire and purple smoke. Beneath on the rocks
the sea complained, that mighty rhapsodist whose
words declared the troubled destinies of all mankind.
For as the wind is often hushed, luring the
ocean into sleep, so doubt and anguish cease at
times, only to mock mankind the more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was with Rosamunde that summer night
as she stood alone on the wind-swept walls and
watched the sun go down in flame. All hope had
ebbed from her, and her pure faith had, like an
angel, spread its wings, and vanished into the
distant gloom. The sky seemed but an iron
dome, riveted above the helpless world. All
eloquence had passed away with the unfathomable
truths of life that sometimes vivify and sometimes
kill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had life given her? Insult and pain,
death, terror, and unanswered prayers! Had not
her beauty been a curse? What single blessing
had she won but the strong love of a strong man’s
heart, one fierce melody in the strifes of sound!
And now this one good gift seemed gone, snatched
like a jewel from her breast by the lean hand of a
mocking fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In great bitterness she thrust up her arms and
cried aloud under the sky:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, if there be a God, hear my voice. Give
me some sign that I may know that we are not
brute beasts who live to beget life, then—to die.
Give me some sign of immortality. Show me that
wisdom rules the heavens, that we of earth are not
dust and air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still the sun approached the sea, and still
the hoarse waves laughed below as though there
were no hope in heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great God,” she cried again, her hands outstretched
towards the west, “give me but one word
in my heart, that I may know there is a God, and
that some kindness rules the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet there was no still small voice as that which
spoke to the prophet in the cave when all the discords
of the earth moved him to doubt in God’s
design. The sea and sky were full of life, the wild
woods clamoured and the west wind blew. And
yet there shone no light in heaven to comfort her
whose faith was dim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, with her head adroop, Rosamunde
passed back to the Abbess’s room, and stole in
silently, to find Tristan asleep. A small lamp
burnt on a sconce in the wall, shedding a vague
light on the sleeping man’s face. Rosamunde,
with the look of one very weary, drew a great
wooden chair that had been the Abbess’s towards
the bed, lay back therein, and rested her chin upon
her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night had fallen about Holy Guard, filling
its broken galleries with gloom. The stars were
shining, and from below came the voices of those
who sat at meat in the abbey refectory with
Blanche the Duchess. It was Rosamunde’s vigil,
and no one disturbed her, for she had wine and
bread with her in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the heat of her despair died down
like a fire that lacks for fuel. Her very soul
seemed weary to death, and very lonely in that
silent room. A hundred dark thoughts coursed
through her brain: the sure knowledge that
Tristan would die, that God had deserted her, if
there were a God. Apathy possessed her hour by
hour; afar she heard the sound of the sea, and the
wind in the windows overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the hours passed her eyes grew hot and
heavy with sleep; the long night began to weigh
her down, as Tristan slept on and took no heed.
Soon her head sank upon her shoulder, the very
gloom seemed to grow more dim, and the noise
of the wind ebbed from her ears. She drooped
down in the great chair, her hands lying open in
her lap, her hair clouding over her face. Sleep
wiped the tired lines away from her mouth, and
her large eyes strained towards the lamp no
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Rosamunde dreamed a dream, a
mystic vision, as though the God who watches
over the ways of men had sent some seraph to
His child. It seemed to her that she stood alone
within the ruined chapel upon the rock. The
chapel was full of golden vapour, a magic mist
that seemed to move in luminous whorls towards
the roof. The high altar was hid in gloom, as
though a cloud enveloped it, like purple smoke
over the moon. Even as she stood gazing in silent
awe, a white arm was thrust from out the cloud,
pointing its finger towards the floor that lay below
the altar steps. A golden ray seemed to fall
from the hand upon a stone a full cubit square.
Letters of fire were traced on the flag. The purple
vapour was rent aside, and in that dream shrine
Rosamunde saw the White Christ bending from
the Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe,” the Christ’s eyes seemed to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with a sudden stream of light and a great
sound as of a thunder-clap, the whole chapel
rocked and sank into an abyss that had no ending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cry Rosamunde awoke and stared
around her in the room. Trembling, she sat up
in the chair, awe and fear upon her face, as she
remembered the vision she had seen. Tristan was
still sleeping on the bed, and the great abbey was
silent as death, save that she heard the sound of
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling and amazed, Rosamunde rose up
like one whose soul groped in the dark towards
the truth. She passed her hand over her heavy
eyes, looked at Tristan as he slept close by the
window where the night streamed in. Stung by
sudden hope, she crossed the room, took the lamp
from the sconce in the wall, passed out, and
climbed towards the chapel. Up the great stair
she made her way, the lamplight flashing on the
walls and into her white palm as she shaded the
flame. The wind played round her from above,
moving her hair about her face. Her eyes were
filled with hope and fear, like pools where darkness
and moonlight mingle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So through the gloomy galleries she came into
the chapel of Holy Guard. Standing by the door
with the lamp held high, she looked round under
the ruined roof, as though half thinking to see
her dream repeat its mysteries before her eyes.
The lamplight quivered on the broken stones, the
fallen rafters of the roof, and the snapped pillars
that lay around. Above the altar the Cross still
stood, but there was no purple mist about its
limbs, no golden vapour filling the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holding her lamp above her head, Rosamunde
pressed forward over the ruinous floor towards
the altar shrouded deep in gloom. Bending low,
she gazed at the flagstones one by one as she
passed up the aisle, lifting the broken rafters aside
and thrusting away the fallen tiles. Before the
very altar steps she came to a stone covered with
words which she could not read. Kneeling and
setting the lamp on the floor, she drew a poniard
out of her girdle and worked at the joints with
the point thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the stone lurched up, showing a streak
of darkness beneath, for there was a goodly cavity
under the flag. Bending low, and turning the
stone back on its face, she groped in the darkness
till her fingers touched the smooth lid of a metal
box. Very slowly she lifted it out, laid it in her
lap as she half knelt on the floor, and turned the
clasp that fastened the lid. Lying within was a
glass phial filled with a fluid red as blood, also
some yellow silken stuff that looked to her like an
eastern veil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosamunde set the phial on the floor and held
up the veil before the lamp. Even as the light
came streaming through, a golden halo glowed
round a face calm and grand as the face of a god.
Great awe came down on Rosamunde’s soul, for
she seemed to gaze on the face of the Christ.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER XLIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bearing the casket with the veil and phial
therein, Rosamunde passed out of the chapel of
Holy Guard, down many a gallery and winding
stair, to the room where Tristan slept. The look
of awe still possessed her face, filling her eyes with
solemn shadows, loosening the curves of her proud
mouth. The lamp’s light played upon her hair
as the west wind swayed it to and fro like golden
threads upon the cloak of night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming once more to the Abbess’s room, she
found Tristan sleeping even as she had left him.
A faint grey haze hung in the east, for the dawn
was coming up over the woods and the waters of
the Gloire. Rosamunde set the lamp on the sconce
in the wall, and laid the casket on the great carved
chair. With a rush of tenderness, she stooped and
looked into Tristan’s face, hung over him with
arms outstretched, as though her whole soul gave
him its blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with her face towards the east, she knelt
down by the window, her hands folded upon her
breast. Out of the night she had struggled to
meet the broadening glory of the dawn. Never
before had Rosamunde prayed as she prayed that
hour in Holy Guard. Her soul seemed borne on
wings of fire upwards, ever upwards, till the heavy
world grew bright in the beams of the rising sun.
Ever she seemed to strive with God, and in the
strife her own weak faith caught a trebled courage
from her prayers. Once more the welkin seemed
to wake to the deep mysteries of life and love. The
woods grew green, the waters shone, the clouds
gleamed white against the blue. The voice of the
dawn rang loud and clear, bidding the phantoms
of the night depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new light shone on Rosamunde’s face, as
though hope was reborn within her heart. She
rose up from before the eastern window, took the
casket in her hands, and knelt down at the side
of Tristan’s bed. She smiled as she turned the
coverlet aside, and began to cut the linen bands
stained with the blood that still ebbed through.
So deep was the man’s sleep that he slumbered
on till she turned the last band from the clotted
wound and saw the red stream oozing up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tristan awoke. His hands moved restlessly
to and fro, and Rosamunde, bending over
his body, caught them and held them fast in hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said, with her splendid hair
falling around his haggard face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes questioned hers with a strange wistfulness,
and he breathed deeply, but did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” she said again, with her mouth close
to him, as he lay and looked at her like a child,
“I have dreamed a dream, and God has given me
back your life. This I believe, for my faith has
returned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamunde,” he said, with a great sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie still,” she whispered, “while I dress your
wound with the gifts God has given me in the
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” she answered, “for as I slept the
Christ appeared and bade me believe, and in my
dream he showed me the place in the chapel above
us where relics were buried. Yet, if this dream
fails me at this hour, I shall never believe in
Heaven more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therewith she kissed him on the lips, with
tears brimming in her eyes. Tristan watched her
silently as she took the phial and poured the red
liquid into the wound. Mingling there with the
living blood, it sent forth an odour through the
room as though all the spices of the East, spikenard
and myrrh and wondrous balms, had spent
their perfumes on the air. Then Rosamunde took
the mystic veil, and pressed it deep into the wound,
where it grew red with Tristan’s blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning back against the chair, she half sat,
half knelt beside the bed, watching the man with
all her soul. The streaming sunlight flooded
in, playing upon Tristan’s face with its hollow
cheeks and sunken eyes. In either heart was
poised the chance of life and death that summer
dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly the minutes passed, as though
Time halted in his stride. The lamp had burnt
out on the wall, and birds were awake in the
thickets beneath, their shrill orisons greeting the
dawn. Rosamunde, filled with unrest, watched
no longer beside the bed, but rose and paced from
wall to wall, gazing out through the ruined window
at the Gloire gleaming amid the woods. For the
moment she dared not look at Tristan, lest the
last hope should prove but a dream. A cold hand
seemed on her bosom, pressing heavily on her
heart, while the distant clamour of the sea came
like a dirge into her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Tristan called to her, his voice strong
and resonant as of old, not the half moan of a
dying man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hither, Rosamunde,” he said; “come to me.
What miracle is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned instantly and was at his side, bending
over him with her eyes afire. And lo, the
blood had ceased to flow, and the red veil seemed
clotted fast over the place where the barb was
buried. There was a faint colour on Tristan’s
cheeks, and his eyes had the lustre they had lost
of late. Rosamunde knelt and gazed at his face,
as though half fearful of trusting the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with a low cry she bowed her head, and
laid her hands on the man’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan, you will live,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is strange strength in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dream, the dream!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No longer does the warm blood ebb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised herself from Tristan’s body and
knelt with arms stretched towards the east, a great
glory lighting her face.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER L</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was evening, and Holy Guard was wrapped in
silence, save that the sea laughed and clamoured
on the rocks beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up the great stairway climbed Blanche the
Duchess, with a purple cloak thrown over her
shoulders and a small silver cross held in one
hand. Solemnity dwelt on her face, as though joy
and pain held converse there, while life and love
were not accorded. Shadows there were beneath
her eyes, and a sad smile playing about her mouth.
Her hair seemed whiter than of yore, and age
more manifest, as though her youth gave out at
last, and bowed its head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly she climbed the stair, as though
her heart grew tired apace. The sun came through
in golden beams from the thin squints that pierced
the wall, smiting the silent shadows through,
shadows that seemed to suffer pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she came to the cloister court where
seven tall windows broke the wall, giving view of
the western sea, the great Gloire, and the thronging
woods. About Holy Guard the world seemed
to sweep like a rare tapestry, sea, forest, and
stream, blending azure, silver, and green. The
great abbey seemed arched with gold, an irrefragable
peace begotten of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After standing awhile to look over the sea,
Blanche passed down the long gallery that led
towards the Abbess’s room. She walked noiselessly.
The door of the Abbess’s room stood ajar,
and from within came the sound of voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche halted on the threshold, and gazed in
with a smile hovering in her eyes. Tristan was
lying on the bed half propped on pillows, with
Rosamunde seated at his side. The woman’s arm
was about Tristan’s shoulders, his head half resting
on her breast, her hair falling down on either
side, bathing his face as with golden light. Their
eyes were turned away from Blanche towards the
window in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were talking together, these two who had
come through storms to each other’s arms. Calm
joy seemed theirs and deep content, a golden mood
in which their thoughts were oblivious of all things
save their love. Blanche leant her shoulder against
the wall and watched them in silence, with her
face in shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tristan,” said the woman, “how dim seem
the days when I played the great lady in Joyous
Vale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He half turned his head upon her breast, so
that he could look into her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was but a great boy then,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I a wise fool,” she answered him. “Ah,
Tristan, when shall we women learn that cleverness
suffices not the heart? The great love in a strong
man’s eyes, the trustful clinging of children’s
hands, these are the things that make for
heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” he said to her, taking her hair and
winding a bright tress round his wrist; “we are
wise in small things, unwise in the great. God,
love, and health—Heaven give me these, and I
will not envy any man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Blanche drew back from before the door
with a shadow as of pain upon her face. Such
then was life for those who loved, the godly light
in a husband’s eyes, the trusting smile of an
honoured wife. For her there could be no magic
words, no clinging lips, no straining hands. In
her deep loneliness she turned away, and passed
back to gaze on the restless sea.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
